,hive-180932,cheva,4a7qge,《哥斯拉大战金刚》观后感, the epidemic has been dragged for so long and many large film companies have been unable to afford it and they have taken their own huge investment blockbusters released through streaming platforms for example this godos war king kong mentioned today although chinas epidemic is not popular the cinema line has begun to restore business you can go to the big screen with a good look if you want to save money or have no time to worry about the theater you can also choose to watch online i just watched this on the internet although the effect is a bit worse but it was shocking enough the plot for this special effect is accompanied by the plot but it was pretty good the worldview setting inside is very interesting paying tribute to various conspiracy theories the core is the hollow earth hypothesis according to the setting of the film like godzilla king kong and giant beasts such as mosla before all come from the inside of the earth and the passage of the underneath and the outside world is in antarctica the energy inside the hollow earth does not come from the sun but a high level energy source that humans have never understood so the species in it can grow so huge in fact this setting is not the original screenwriter of this film i have posted a film called steel sky before there are almost the same setting inside however that film also combines other conspiracy theories such as the lizardman the species living in the hollow earth are lizards many big characters in human history are camouflaged by lizards they pretend that they will restore their original identity after their death and live in the underground world such as hitler jobs and so on in gosla vajrayana this film also ridiculed a lot of conspiracy theories for example the government adds fluoride in tap water to make the people more obedient hollywood literary works show various conspiracy theories in such ridiculous ways i dont think it has any good effects although this allows the audience to subtly attribute various conspiracy theories as jokes or neuropathy it can offset the negative effects of some conspiracy theories but this is actually to encourage people not to think about everything that the mainstream media or the propaganda department says if you add fluoride to the water it will make people more obedient i dont know but the mainstream culture will render the conspiracy theory into a joke this will definitely achieve a similar effect in addition most of the time king kong and godzilla hit you to die but in the end the real villain was a mechanical godzilla created by a large human company and the energy of the mechanical godzilla is the stealing earth hearted energy sources in recent years the villains in mainstream films have almost no exception they only recognize money do not pay attention to the environment and do not pay attention to the interests of the poor it seems that all problems are caused by them this is also the contradiction between the mainstream culture to mislead the people after all the company operates market oriented its way to survive is to meet the needs of consumers and benefit the society but now many large companies choose to mix with the government to restrict competition through legislation which must be condemned but the problem is still on the government that has power the other is to give the audience a human exploration of nature and the development of new technology and new energy which is an evil act as if everything is naturally the best just like the a brief history of humanity i read recently it is constantly touting how leisure and richness of human life collected by hunting and how depressed the human life engaged in agricultural production do not recognize the progress brought by the agricultural revolution at all the daughter of the capitalist and the protagonist in this film followed king kong getting the land hearted energy is to do bad things so the end was pinched by dalongdas slap although the special effects of this film are very exciting the thoughts conveyed are disregarding sometimes this beautifully packaged poisonous grass may have a worse impact on the subtle influence than the simple and rude brainwashing anti japanese drama in china,"{""profile"":{""location"":""likerid:supercheva"",""profile_image"":""https://s1.ax2x.com/2018/02/23/P2SJq.png""}}","{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://s1.ax2x.com/2018/02/23/P2SJq.png"",""location"":""China

documentes and others thats a little information about the definition of film or movie the information was quoted from various sources and references hope it can be useful tv movie the first television shows were experimental sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the televised events such as the summer olympics in germany the coronation of king george vi in the uk and david sarnoffs famous introduction at the new york worlds fair in the us spurred a growth in the medium but world war ii put a halt to develop the war the world movie inspired many americans to buy their first television set and then in the popular radio show texaco star theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show earning host milton berle the name mr television and demonstracting that the medium was a stable modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers the first national live television broadcast in the us took place on september when president harry trumans speech at the japanese peace treaty conference in san francisco was transmitted over at ts transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets the first national color broadcast the tournament of roses parade in the us occurred on january during the following ten years most network broadcasts and nearly all local programming continued to be in blackandwhite a color transition was annouded for the fall of during which over half of all network primetime programming would be broadcast in color

genres see also list of genres film and television formats and genres television shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented a show may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or nonfictional as in documentary news and reality television it may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some madefortravision films or historical as in the case of mary documentaries and fictional movie they could be primary instructional or education or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows a drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting the program follows their lives and adventures before the exception for soap operatype serials typically rmained static without story arcs and the main characters and premise changed little if so changed happened to the characters lives during the episode it was used undon by the end becuse of this the episodes could be broadcast in any order since the many movie feature progressive change in the plot the characters or booth for instance hill street blues and st elsewhere were two of the first american prime time drama television movie to have this kind of dramatic structure while the later movie babylon further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intendevd fiveseason run in it was postponed that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies income than film some also noted the incredase in quality of some

where it accounted for of cases by january according to figures analysed by researchers in brazil experts fear the proliferation of the brazil variant will mean increasing cases for several months dr miguel nicolelis who until recently was the coordinator of the pandemic response team in northeastern brazil told the bbc that the countrys response amounted to a complete calamity its the largest

the city of manaus in the brazilian amazon and sequenced in early january it has mutations on the spike protein that part of the virus which attaches to human cells and it is these mutations which are thought to make it more transmissible the variant is thought to have emerged in amazonas state in november spreading quickly in the state capital manaus where it accounted for of cases by january according to figures analysed by researchers in brazil preliminary data suggested it could be up to twice as infectious as the original strain while more recent research puts that figure even higher

when chuck travels to resolve the productivity of fedex or known as federal express he did not expect that the airplane that he is riding on is going to crash in the pacific ocean though he escaped through the inflatable life raft and survived but he washes up on an island where no one lives after the incident when he is already in conscious all he want is to leave the island he is the only person on that island until he found the body of the pilot on the shore he get the dead body of the pilot and buried it with the dead body of the pilot fedex packages also were washed up on the shore he open some of it to use for his daily needs but there is one package that he didnt open because he knew that one day he can leave the island and will personally give it to the owner of the package as the days go by at the island chuck already adapt the nature of the island he knows how to survive alone how to make a fire and how to get food just to survive he uses the coconut as his water he lives in the cave and in the cave hes alone one day hes been injured as he make a fire he was mad he get the ball and throw it the ball is full of blood caused by his injured hand when he looked at the ball their is a name wilson the brand of the ball that is the time that he started to imagine that the ball is his imaginary friend time and time again he talked the ball like his best friend everything he do he talked wilson the ball about his life chuck slept in the cave and there he wrote and count every single day to know how long he has been in that island he lived in the island for years until one day as he slept he hear something noisy and was awake he get up and found out that it was a sail he pull it to the shore but it was broken because of the wind until he realizes that he will make a sail to be used in leaving the island on the next day he started to make a native boat he get some wood and peel the tree to make a rope after making his own boat he waited for the wind to change direction for him to fight the waves that keeps in pushing him back to the island when he already conquered the waves he is very happy that he can now leave the island together with wilson his imaginary friend as the days passed by as he was in the middle of the sea without water he looked for wilson but the ball was floating far away from his boat he tried to get back the wilson but he didnt get it back because its already too far from him until their is a cargo vessel found him and bring him home when he finally got home his friends and his other colleagues of fedex were shocked that chuck noland is alive even his girlfriend was very shocked all of them expect that chuck noland is already dead because its almost years that he is totally missing chuck was very sad after knowing that his girlfriend had a family already chuck noland was disappointed telling his girlfriend that she must live with her husband and child chuck noland decided to deliver the package that he promised to deliver it personally to the owner when he was still there in the island he promised to be the personal courrier of that package when he delivered the package the owner of the package was

,hive-108451,blessselona,the-usefulness-of-tether-usdt,THE USEFULNESS OF  TETHER USDT,tether usdt tether is a blockchainbased cryptocurrency whose cryptocoins in circulation are backed by an equivalent amount of traditional fiat currencies like the dollar the euro or the japanese yen which are held in a designated bank account we can say that tether usdt is a stablecoin a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency which aims to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable tether is used by crypto investors who want to avoid the extreme volatility of other cryptocurrencies while keeping value within the crypto market in april the new york attorney general accused tethers parent company of hiding an million loss tether tokens trade under the usdt symbol understanding tether usdt tether belongs to a breed of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins which aim to keep cryptocurrency valuations stable as opposed to the wide swings observed in the prices of other popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum that would allow it to be used as a medium of exchange and a mode of storage of value instead of being used as a medium of speculative investments how tether started it all begins with the realcoin project realcoin entered the market via its whitepaper in july the whitepaper caused a huge stir amongst the community for several reasons aside from its revolutionary technical aspects the papers publishers are some of the most reputable names in the market specifically tethers whitepaper lists cofounders brock pierce reeve collins and craig sellarsinterestingly the realcoin name didnt last very long in november the santa monica based startup decided it was time to dawn a new title tether notably tether entered the market with a threepronged approach the platform introduced three stablecoins as part of its entry strategy the first coin was ustether this token featured a peg with the us dollar the second coin pegged its value to euros and the last coin focused on the japanese yen the latter being known as yentether bitfinex connection bitfinex became the first exchange to introduce tether into its platform in january instantly stablecoins became a success the exchange saw huge user activity regarding this token consequently bitfinex became the leading exchange in terms of tether trading it wasnt long before researchers began to question tethers solvency it was the first stablecoin in the market and its unprecedented rise to success was not without concern these concerns led researchers to delve deep into the tether bitfinex connect in a group of independent researchers from the international consortium of investigative journalists released the paradise papers this document confirmed some of the worst fears of those in the market at the time the documents showed that both tether and bitfinex shared the same management and corporate structure researchers discovered that both entities listed the same chief executive chief financial officer chief strategy officer and general counsel in their corporate documentation the founder of tether a graduate of yale by the advantages such as there is no need for making complex calculations when performing buysell transactions of the coins using tether trading on the exchange without the digital dollar can be performed in the following way at the very beginning the trader needs to find the best applicable currency pair the most commonly used one is bitcoin or ethereum firstly he needs to determine the amount of these coins required for buying preferred coins afterwards perform the exchange and purchase them such transactions with using digital dollar are running regularly without any peculiarities speed transferring big amounts of digital money may take hours or even days though when it comes to tether the other side can receive it within a minute release has provoked the cryptocurrency exchanges development and made digital money more convenient to buy and sell many investors took advantage from opportunities offered by usdt if you are planning to buy cryptocurrency on exchange that is not working with fiat money you should definitely take tether into consideration disadvantage although there is no problem in updating it is weak in terms of audits it is centralistic not centralized along with the banks it works with it is also dependent on legal institutions how safe and secure is tether security in cryptocurrency has received a modern security system that provides high reliability user information is hidden although the coin is pegged to the us dollar it is digital being based on blockchain transaction fees banks are taking commissions for transferring classic dollars sending tether is free of any hidden additional charges stability a tight peg to the us dollar successfully solves the cryptocurrencies high volatility problem that is why many investors move to tether when the digital asset market collapses when discussing tethers weaknesses the only thing coming to mind is the possible centralization growth the tight peg to dollar increases such risks even though the developers assure this will never happen conclusion tether trading is safe and is reliable and is fast when doing transferring just watch the the market strategist before you go into it and always check for updates

,hive-106951,karimraj,important-discussions-on-various-power-plants-and-gas-turbines,Important discussions on various power plants and gas turbines,dear friends all hope everybody is doing well today i have come before you with some important information about power plants and gas turbines this article will discuss the basics of power plants i hope you will get a clear idea about power plants and gas turbines by reading this article so lets see what is in this article a few words about the power plant power generation plant is abbreviated as power station or power station in english there are many things in the power station but the generator is one of them which is rotated by different devices as we know generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy the question may be how this generator is rotated you can understand the answer to this question by reading the whole article what is a turbine a turbine is basically a machine or prime mover where the rotational speed is obtained by constantly changing the momentum of the current simply put a turbine is a rotating mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and is used for useful purposes electric power is generated through generators with the help of turbines there are different types of turbines such as steam turbines gas turbines water turbines etc if we look at ashuganj power station where steam turbines have been used in units and gas turbines in the remaining units the steam turbine is the ideal prime mover that is widely used large steam turbines are used to operate power plant generators hydraulic power plant when it comes to hydraulic power plants the first thing that comes to mind is our kaptai power plant turbines are run using the potential energy of water the bengali word for hydraulic means hydraulic then we understand in the general sense that the main source of hydraulic power plant is water hydraulic power plants are basically hydroelectric power plants and to put it a little simpler water is trapped in a high place when highaltitude water is allowed to flow downwards it flows with great speed this water flow basically turns the wheel of the turbine the turbine then starts spinning with the speed of water the shaft of the generator is firmly attached to the shaft of the turbine this causes the generator to start rotating and generates current thermal power plant a thermal power plant or thermal power plant is a type of power plant whose thermal energy is converted into electrical power water is evaporated in thermal power plants and the boiler does this job in other words thermal power plants have boilers which convert water into steam this steam is again flowed towards the turbine at high speed this steam basically rotates the turbine and we know that the turbine is connected to the generator so that the generator generates current nuclear power plant a nuclear power station is a thermal power plant where the heat source is a nuclear reactor nuclear power plants are also called thermal power plants nuclear power plants have nuclear reactors in place of boilers in this nuclear reactor there is a nuclear fission reaction ie many nuclei spontaneously split or release energy by affecting one part to another as a result a lot of heat is generated and this heat is used to turn water into steam steam basically helps to rotate the turbine so that the generator also starts to rotate and electricity is generated wind power plant the word wind in bengali means wind that is electricity is generated by using wind energy wind power largely depends on the flow of air the wind turbine starts to rotate as a result of the wind flow the turbine is connected to the generator the generator converts this rotating mechanical power into electrical power solar power plant solar power in bengali means solar energy a solar power plant is a power plant that converts sunlight energy into electrical energy this electric energy is converted directly using photovoltaic and indirectly through centralized solar energy centralized solar energy uses lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus much larger areas towards a specific amount of sunlight photovoltaic cells basically convert light energy into electrical energy what is a gas turbine a turbine is a rotating engine that receives energy from the flow of combustible gas for example jet aircraft whose engines are much larger this engine is basically powered by turbofan this is an example of a turbophan gas turbine we have discussed different power plants in the above articles each power plant has turbines except for solar power plants steam turbines wind turbines water turbines etc are used for power generation in various power plants and the practical application of all this is basically gas turbine gas turbine engines use high pressure gas to rotate the blades thanks for reading the

,news,fullshowbox,boris-johnson-desperately-needs-a-more-coherent-china-strategy,Boris Johnson desperately needs a more coherent China strategy, london cnnlike many of its global counterparts the united kingdom is in desperate need of a china strategy many of the worlds middling to large economies have benefited from inward chinese investment since the global financial crisis of for over a decade chinas extraordinary wealth offered an obvious way out of recession when options for investment elsewhere were limited fast forward to and the decision to woo an authoritarian government with alleged ambitions to challenge the united states as the primary global superpower looks nave china has become a hot issue in british politics over the past months as lawmakers and activists have become aware of how much the uk relies on a country that stands against many of the things that it claims to uphold and many in london are worried that prime minister boris johnson has neither the time nor imagination to adequately handle one of britains greatest foreign challenges in recent months johnson has approved sanctions against chinese officials over human rights abuses in xinjiang and hong kong and condemned china for retaliatory sanctions against british lawmakers at the same time however he has also insisted he is fervently sinophile and warned against starting a new cold war on china johnsons government recently published a review of the countrys postbrexit foreign affairs in which it was noted that china will contribute more to global growth than any other country in the next decade and economies such as the uk will need to engage with china and remain open to chinese trade and investment it also not unreasonably points out that if global challenges like climate change are to be adequately addressed the international community will require beijings cooperation however the report also acknowledges in tempered language that china is a systemic competitor and the biggest statebased threat to the uks economic security this has left many in the uk wondering exactly where johnsons head and heart lie when it comes to what he admits is the likely the greatest challenge to western democracy even those whove worked closely with johnson struggle to present a single view of his stance guto harri johnsons former director of communications during his time as london mayor points to their trips to beijing in as johnson took the olympic and paralympic flags back to london in preparation for the games as partly informing his view of the country it was a strange time to be in china we were there on september just two days after lehman brothers had filed for bankruptcy harri said there was a striking juxtaposition between the collapse of a huge american bank while china was dazzling the world with its show of strength however he felt johnson was not as smitten as others in the uk when one of us said how amazing the ceremony had been boris said yes if you like humanity being reduced to speckles of light in a kaleidoscope he instinctively didnt like the uniformity of the communist state this story tallies with the view his allies are putting forward that johnson sees the need for a balanced approach to china that doesnt discourage global trade but reduces the reliance on chinesestate backed investment and technology china has systematically become a leader in the technologies of the future while also investing in other nations infrastructure projects simultaneously it has become one of the most sophisticated rivals to the west in terms of cyber warfare creating the problem that if you want to take advantage of cheaper chinese technology or other innovations you do so at the alleged risk of beijing stealing state secrets and intellectual property though the chinese government has repeatedly and vehemently denied these accusations british lawmakers are well aware of the apparent conundrum in the last decade the uk has become reliant on china for a variety of critical infrastructure the stateowned china general nuclear power corporation has a stake in the uks underconstruction hinkley point c nuclear power station and has invested in other future nuclear projects china national offshore oil corporation also claims that it provides more than of the uks oil production and of the countrys energy needs and despite the uks plan to remove equipment made by the chinese tech giant huawei from the nations network by those networks are already up and running on top of this british investment in china has grown significantly postbrexit the royal united services institute rusi published a report last year showing that in investment from the uk to china grew to billion on the previous year despite the wishes of hawks china is a reality that britain cannot wish away as much as some critics of beijing believe johnson is on their side people who worked with johnson during his stint as foreign secretary say there was nothing to suggest he was a sinophile during two years in the job johnson visited india japan australia new zealand but never china this according to those familiar annoyed chinese diplomats who were eager to point out china invested more in the uk than any other european nation china hawks might also take comfort in the recently published review and its commitment to lead a global ocean deployment that will visit the indopacific with the us and other allies a move that will doubtless irritate beijing which has accused washington of attempting to sow discord in the region however there is equally compelling evidence of the prime ministers fondness for china leaving aside the kind words he has written as a columnist for the daily telegraph at the height of the avian flu crisis johnson wrote that the emergence of china and its integration into the world economy has been a major spur to growth and a deterrent to inflation it is an unalloyed good members of his family have strong ties to china his father stanley met with the chinese ambassador in early to discuss chinas role in climate change and conservation according to the embassys website the elder johnson complimented chinas achievements in environmental protection and ecological conservation and its outstanding contribution to addressing global climate change meanwhile boris younger brother max runs an investment firm that specializes in facilitating investment in china and chinese companies whatever the prime ministers true feelings toward china the uk is a long way from having a coherent longterm strategy for balancing relations johnsons recent condemnations might suggest a more hostile tone but critics note that right now criticism is caveated with the need to trade and cooperate there hasnt been a huge amount of concrete policy that actually impacts china said benedict rogers a conservative party activist and adviser to the interparliamentary alliance on china the offer of british national overseas passports to hong kong citizens and sanctions on chinese officials attracted beijings ire but china is used to being criticized while carrying on as normal rogers added that johnsons government has a habit of trying to have its cake and eat it and thinks this is ultimately its approach to china cakeism isnt necessarily a bad approach david lidington previously de facto deputy prime minister and now chairman of rusi said the only way to really alter chinas behavior is to become less reliant on its economic and technological heft talking about banning individual companies like tiktok or huawei is a bit of a distraction the only way to contain china is a unified western response and to build up our own capacity in things like artificial intelligence and biotechnologies he said for britain that means facilitating conversations between europe the us and other democracies on how we regulate things like data and other new technologies johnson has long claimed that the uks postbrexit prosperity would be built on trading relations with the wider world in that context the country cannot ignore china and could soon be forced into a corner it is likely that over the next decade or so as china becomes more dominant a narrative will emerge where countries will be presented with a choice between the usled west and china whether that choice is real or not it could easily be presented that way lidington said the european unions strategic autonomy objective is aimed at avoiding just that by walking a middle road using the might of its single market and regulatory powers to remain independent of the two hyperpowers but having quit the bloc the uk is no longer part of that ecosystem and cannot leverage its power acting as a bridge between europe and america on cooperation in the technology arms race could be a natural role for the uk however balancing this with leaving the door open for chinese investment will require not only complicated international diplomacy but careful handling inside johnsons own conservative party there is a divide in the party there are those who understand that completely cutting off china would be damaging and those for whom china postbrexit is a new and important dimension to determine our place in the world said salma shah a former government adviser downing street must seriously consider how it will present even an early strategy in a way that satisfies both sides johnson has made a career out of keeping people guessing as to what he really thinks and the postbrexit reality presents him with a world of both new opportunity and new dangers when it comes to china both opportunity and danger are hurtling towards him faster than he could have ever imagined if hes to win the confidence of his loyalists at home and allies overseas he may need to drop the cakeist politics that have previously served him so well and start putting some solid ideas for tackling china at a global level on the table the future of his country could depend on

historian meeting yeosung donghoehoe the enforcement decree of the misdemeanor punishment act it was first enacted in previously the relevant criminal law and legal terminology were similar but in the amendment the legal terms were revised in the direction as easy as possible for example a teacher an assistant is explained by solving it as a person who has sinned or helped since the criminal law corresponding to the basic law is conservative in the revision of the term it may be a significant heterogeneity in the misdemeanor punishment law that is used to change the term itself while studying the criminal law since it is a law enacted for the purpose of maintaining order the punishment has been changed several times so the revised history can indirectly grasp the social image of the time for example which in the past it was also punished for selling foods without covering food and carrying long hair in the amendment some of the stalking acts were added to some minor acts although the documentation is also shown this should be regarded as setting the lower limit through the revision of the misdemeanor punishment act which could not be punished by punishment such as criminal law in addition the maintenance of some terms has been made and the term significant has been revised to sufficient some of the misdemeanor crimes have been strengthened by dividing the types of misdemeanor crimes that need to be punished a little bit more and the types of acts that can be punished for won and won in a single item of less than won are also divided korean reactor uljin unit installed the

Snake bite. 12vo CONCURSO DE REDACCIÓN DE HISTORIAS!! / Por @fjjrg, source this is my participation in the stories writing contest by fjjrg i have always wanted to create a more venezuelan version of a story and take advantage of the present to do so i must notice that we usually always paint our dialogues with very illustrative metaphors in the sierra de perij edo zulia there is a place known as the salto el rosario de perij located in the co gollo river ecoparque we were a group of friends camping during a common weekend enjoying the wonders of nature that same day when installing the camp and cleaning the surroundings there was a shout of terror and fear one of the girls found a snake was rolled by warning of their attack on those present a guide yukpa took the snake said we were not afraid as long as they would not attack her she would not mouth to anyone showed her so that we could admire her beauty and then took her from the site after lunch we made an excursion to the jet the waterfall rises powerful to its meters high several tourists were taking photos of the site when suddenly a woman starts screaming take me away take it away despite the warning that he did not move the woman tried to take off and between running and throwing her arms from one place to another was bitten by the snake falling prey to panic on the grass venezuelan version we all went to help even our guide although it was more to see than to help since none knew how to proceed with a snake bite the woman stirred on the floor by grabbing her arm ranting all her fury against the destination that had led her to the park his mothers pussy who sent me to come here i had to have stayed in my house with so much malandro that is in the neighborhood and i am killing a snake stay still another woman who looked like her family shouted pal pussy mom do you think this pod does not hurt the woman replied furious clenching her face that became more and more chinese than a japanese smiling a cachite approached him with tears in his eyes hold on aunt marta pedro went to ask for a cell phone with a signal to call an ambulance the news did not decrease at all the pain of his arm what signal fuck will there be here if we have where we live he spat with more poison that the same snake had used the guide was not directly to the injured woman the first thing he did was check the area and among the bushes he finally found what he was looking for he extended with his two arms from side to side showing the length of the snake cone size x replied impressed what did the indiection say that asked the woman on the ground that had thought that the indian came to his aid however to his surprise he disappeared among the trees something of a size said maria her mother who although she had begun to pray with a rosary of accounts as great as metras still did not stop paying attention to what was happening around her a mapanare corrected members of our group cock what was missing now i fuck even the indian ran the injured woman shouted resigned and now what do we do grandmother asked a little girl go see if pedro managed to communicate with someone said maria another of our group whispered the mapanares can even kill and if not you always fuck for you even lose your arm or leg where you have itchy bite said another tell the guevones those who shut up and leave if you have nothing to do marta rezon who kept squeezing her arm as if wanting to tear it out the yukpa guide appeared surprisingly along with a chinchorro and medicinal plants release your arm he ordered marta who kept covering the wound his arm was red and began to swell there were a couple of tiny holes where a small thread of blood sprouted the guide said a few words that nobody understood but they suspected were in their indigenous language he sucked the wound after spitting several times placed a poultice of crushed plants on it and then covered it with a bandage marta began to feel dizziness and had stopped curse for his relatives it was a sign of bad omen mastique this the guide put a roll of wrapped leaves in his mouth maria had finished praying her ave maras in record time help me with this said the guide signaled to mrs del rosario the chinchorro unrolled and extended it on the ground requested the help of those present especially maria to carefully lift marta and place her inside the chinchorro another present lent help and between the two built both extremes of chinchorro and thus improvised a stretcher with which they moved marta to the closest vehicle the guide told them that the poultice would help fight poison and symptoms but it was necessary to take it to a dispensary where they could administer the antidote then he prohibited the child from accompanying him in the car nobody is going to separate me from my aunt replied the upset girl the woman with the rule crosses healing the guide explained without giving more detail he took his chinchorro and returned with the group of the expedition grandma maria explained to her granddaughter that the indigenous people had a very special mystique with nature and in her experience it was better to pay attention to the guides recommendations so it was better to go along with his brother pedro martas relatives thanked the soul to the guide before leaving all witnesses who had just witnessed the exploits of guia yukpa we feel much more comfortable and safe their advice and protection english version ive always wanted to create a more venezuelan version of a story and im taking this opportunity to do so im going to try

and books and often testified before wishes to use the word or voice of god against us can use to transmit its just like everything else in the hands of the nefarious they exploit and use it to further their wicked agenda but in the hands of good it is used for good to connect with could also be used for bad to manipulate deceive and have the forces of evil gain power can transmit this energy those in control do not want this technology getting out as people will wake up and see they do not need as much of the garbage being pushed or continue to fall for the lies they will lose control with mass immigration these people are not very technological and easily controlled they use your own mind against sunrise was used in iran to create an islamic superpower with this technology iran did show the pope multiple miracles good magic trick john brennan and john kerry have been negotiating with iran to bring some of this technology back was mover to china because they have no problems with experimenting on people israel has banned have taken the voice of god away from us and are using it against us the people doing this have separated themselves so much that love is painful for them they do not want to lose their fortunes and power so continue to push this crowds public opinion sales trends riots even brain damage attempts to use it against the president is why john is speaking up if we do not get on top of this before it is too late we will be willing participants in our own destruction being aware that it is being used is a good start in combating it get the message out it is a part of why there are so many blatant lies going around we are all going to have to face it in one way or another our perceptions ideas and freewill is at points out that this is why they hate those of us who can detect reality along with their ploys and agendas we stand directly in their path to completely enslave the general is why we see massive immigration because many of them are easily controlled and use their minds against them it was what they gave to iran as operation gave them the technology and nuclear weapons so they could become the first islamic superpower so obama gave them because he wanted to prove to people his belief that islam is they had this frequency the voice of god what is believed to be literally the first word god were claiming they were using it for miracles but they used it against the was mentioned in the daily kos in there has been much attention given in recent years to nonlethal focused energy weapons designed to incapacitate enemy troops or an unruly mob without a lot of blood and severed body parts and is a weapon known as the active denial system which transmits a beam that makes people feel like their skin is on fire and then there is something called lrad long range acoustic device which can be used to transmit noise loud enough to make people it can transmit the voice of it is apparently being used to iraq to do just it appears that some of the troops in iraq are using as opposed to lrad to mess with enemy fighters islamic terrorists tend to be superstitious and of course very religious lrad can put the of into their heads if god in the form of a voice that only you can hear tells you to surrender or run away what are you gonna shot at from meters away you can say something like your weapons and put your hands you can say something like is the voice of allah i command you to if the guys on the receiving end are the type who believe there are virgins waiting for them in paradise they might just believe allah is actually talking to them when it fact its probably some guy from des at first glance this might seem like a good thing if you can clear people from a building by telling them you are god thats preferable to calling in an air this would also seem like a more benign weapon than its cousin the socalled death ray ads that makes your skin feel like its on fire in fact lrad seems to be moving forward precisely because the death ray just sounds so deployed under the obama shot at in daily so instead of making iraqis feel like they are on fire we are making them believe god is speaking to iraqis are so since we liberated them they have been shot at roadblocks blown up in random suicide truck bombings kidnapped by death squads driven from their homes in ethnic cleansing campaigns forced to endure brutal summers with little or no electricity and rounded up and sent to abu we are messing with their sure many people think the voice of god weapon is just harmless fun and maybe those subjected to it will feel no aftereffects greater than embarrassment cant believe i fell for or maybe its another example that shows that the law of unintended consequences is at work in iraq a weapon like voice of god might sound great back in the lab but when its put to use in the field there is no telling what will is equipment and is broadcast is efficient but doesnt move as much information as fiber believes president trump was trying to regulate how its made and disperse it so it cant be used against president trump has signaled this you start digging it becomes clear if youve been part of the quantum research that this isnt just on a physical level but that wall is part of the metaphysical and too few in the general public understand where they really shot at frequencies works in are perfect to replicate the voice of in the hands of good healing the hands of the nefarious predatory and would be behind all other signals being sent tell a vision box phone could absolutely be used to manipulate us in the hands of the they want you to believe a song is popular you will youll love dont songs not all of us are crazy about already play on the they already decide who is pushed and furthered and who is they want you to invest in a company they can control the stock dont they already affect public opinion through avenues like their corporate owned media and perceptions of what is trendy or should be they already establish fashion trends music entertainment like movies and series idols perception and peoples perceived reality cant they already project any illusion they desire they recently have one of their own present blood shoes through a remake of nike while lap dancing the beast baphomet or satan he comes under many names so pick vetted evidence frames story of the pentagram blood we had this seen at one of their recent awards show where they worship these people who have so much money they have multiple homes take numerous self serving trips and live a lavish glutenous lifestyle all while people in africa are hungering and shot at the cabals operation is to take gods voice away from us and use it to manipulate use hate to operate instead of love but make it look like their hate is twisted which is how evil operates its said it would be this unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for are seeing this happen even within our own families as many demonstrate the mark they bear is the mark of the beast system by their actions that go directly against what the bible timothy king james version this know also that in the last days perilous times shall for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be will remember how the corporate owned media told you she would cabal knew they would have to have an alternate rout if they couldnt deliver as obama took the first years to weaken america while picking off generals committed to the side of good so they could install and infiltrate with their people in high places and hillary was supposed to take the next is why brennan has referred in the past to star wars and their comms it involved this technology being manipulated by them to serve their own shot at shot at though they used project looking glass it doesnt look that far out and evil can never really win because in the end god knows it too he knows that bible gods word the word is god as stated in john john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was dont realize just how powerful that really satan can do is make things horrible and wretched for everyone all while exploiting the most innocent of our population the children and the elderly who have no say no thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to is why those sold out or who bear the mark of the beast cant stand those of us who heeded gods call to stand up for his most innocent evil hates are all committed to the light and they to the darkness and their darkness will not be able to stand the the beginning of what you know as time humanity created in gods image think of as time and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the will continue to end it and the followers of darkness sense he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in corinthians be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with john then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his john he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until peter we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your want to be in the can try to keep people in their darkness by trying to control thought patterns peoples opinions incite hate and violence it gives them a lot of power unless the side of good gets it out of their is a military intelligence operation that has been doing just that for years can do what they want to people and people have no memory of was moved to china for a reason the cabal has no problem experimenting on people over there and

,news,haiholatesgo,scientists-debate-who-would-really-win-godzilla-vs-kong,Scientists Debate Who Would Really Win Godzilla vs. Kong,two days before the release of most highly anticipated grudge match godzilla vs king kong theres a much smaller battle taking place across my screen nathaniel j dominy and ryan calsbeek share much in commontheyre colleagues scientists dartmouth professorsbut their areas of expertise werent an existential threat to their friendship until recently one of them nathaniel studies primates the other ryan reptiles and amphibians in over coffee the two professors forged a bond when they realized they could write a paper examining godzillas evolutionary growth in cinema dating back to the original they each grew up with the original versions of the characters ryan watched the blackandwhite godzilla movies as a kid on saturdays while nathaniel saw them as a teenager while watching mystery science theater but theres a difference between collaborating on a piece solely about godzilla and weighing in on a battle royale between lizards and apes so when the two logged onto zoom a conversation ostensibly about using science to settle a decadeslong debate quickly became a way for each to hash out their relationships with the iconic monsters nathaniel and ryan looked at three main areas that would impact a fight between godzilla and kong anatomy geography and intelligence previous matchups between the two titans were used as evidence since the latest movie wasnt yet released during the time of the interview well try our best to avoid spoilers at least until the end the anatomy in nathaniel and ryans paper godzillas extraordinary growth over time mirrors an increase in anthropocene angst they describe the titular character as a ceratosaurid dinosaur and lazarus taxon in comparison king kong is just a big gorilla albeit very anatomically similar to his nonskull island brethren related an ode to the humans in godzilla vs kong godzilla vs kong is a beast of a blockbuster a gorilla has really long arms whereas godzilla has relatively short and stumpy arms nathaniel begins in our interview so i think thats one of the biggest advantages that king kong has over godzilla now if youve seen the original movie king kong lands some punches but a gorilla cannot form a fist in the same way that we humans can because its fingers are too long so i imagine king kong doing some head slaps right if this was some kind of mma cage fight i think king kong definitely has the advantage because of the reach ryan interjects in the original film there is some punching and unrealistic though that may be godzilla is counterattacking with his tail ryan says so the reach advantage he loses that if godzilla can use these spin moves and swing that massive tail ryan begins to describe the energy and fat reserves reptiles store in their tails then moments later nate describes how primates bilaterally compressed claws evolved into fingernails which arent as fatal as claws much of the backandforth between nathaniel and ryan unfolds this way with emotional defenses leading to scientific explanations it becomes clear that judging the two beasts based on their anatomy alone wont provide a satisfactory answer the geography the two scientists main point of contention deals with the geographical location that will host the fight using king kong vs godzilla as a reference point specifically the films conclusion where the monsters battle in the pacific ocean the colleagues think whoever is more suited to water will inevitably reign supreme i think the advantage goes to kong because as an endotherm hes going to have a greater heat reserve before he loses all his energy to the cold water in the ocean ryan says whereas godzilla being an ectotherm i think will dump body heat almost immediately and be rendered essentially immobile i would disagree nathaniel counters the problem with being in the water for king kong is that his muscle density is too high a gorilla has a muscle density thats four times greater than a human being no great ape has ever figured out how to swim once hes on the water i think hes in trouble if godzilla is closer in biology to a marine iguana he might fare better ryan admits since these types of iguanas can emerge from freezing water bask in the sun and raise their body temperature they can survive in water when many reptiles cant but theres one final factor that might give the edge to godzilla godzilla also has this potentially internal heat source in the presence of this thermonuclear reactor in his body ryan says so its hard to say for sure the intelligence besides godzilla and king kongs physical characteristics their defining traits are the way they respond to humans in most depictions godzilla has the emotional and mental acuity of a hurricane by comparison kong is often horny for blonde women and makes friends with very young humans of all the topics discussed godzilla and kongs intelligence was the rare topic where both scientists agreed in what we would call the statistical relationship or the linear regression between brain size and body massso how big is your brain relative to your body sizeking kong is going to have a huge advantage nathaniel admits the reptilian brain is not only small per unit body size but they lack a highly convoluted prefrontal cortex theyre not doing a lot of abstract thinking im trying to avoid saying that reptiles are stupid but they are quite dumb yeah ryan says in agreement as a result of kongs superior brain hes the macgyver of very large monsters with the ability to repurpose whatevers around him into weapons buildings trees planes etc this trait is something that scientists observe in real gorillas in the wild weve seen gorillas using sticks to probe water to assess the depth of water before they wade in very carefully and never over their head nathaniel continues so we know that gorillas will use sticks and that they have the potential to use tools in captivity we can train gorillas to use them thats definitely a check in the king kong column is his ability to use external devices to battle a godzilla who will win after much back and forth and deferring the two pick who they think will emerge victorious from the fight my personal view is that godzilla is going to win this fight ryan says my scientific view is that kong should have the advantage but i think that the forces are going to mount in godzillas favor king kong for sure nate responds before the two depart i ask the secondmost important question of the day depending upon who wins and loses will this affect your professional or personal relationship definitely ryan says the tiebreaker in an effort to bring a definitive conclusion to this debate i brought in c m kosemen an artist and researcher who specializes in speculative evolution alongside john conway and darren naish he released the book all yesterdays unique and speculative views of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals which sought to challenge the way dinosaurs have been illustrated for decades i invent drawings in which i try to imagine how life would evolve under other circumstances he says over zoom when i approached kosemen with the same question posed to nathaniel and ryan he offered two traits that give kong the advantage family structure and intelligence in a realworld setting the first benefit for kong is the size of a primates family according to koseman if this were the real world kong would have an extended family ready to give godzilla the hands and outsmart him at every turn primates always come with family structures koseman says so in a kind of even setting king kong would have like two of his sons and his brother and maybe his uncles sons they would be a whole clan and they would be jumping up and down on godzilla until he didnt move anymore but the real death blow for godzilla goes back to his dumb lizard brain in terms of intelligence the big dinosaur has very little chance of outsmarting the big gorilla king kongs primate instincts give him an edge because primates are adaptable kosemen says maybe kong would take in a punch or two or he would be wounded but then very quickly he would learn how he could duck behind the chrysler building or punch through another skyscraper to hit him i mean he could just simply run and hide until godzilla tires himself out and at night pounce on him and be done with it the winner king kong after much controversy and debate science has ruled that king kong would be the winner despite the primates lackluster performance in adam wingards movie kong has the intelligence athleticism and physical traits necessary to take down the worlds most famous giant reptile but sometimes corporate machinations and atomic breath are enough to thwart even the most gifted scientific minds kong bows to no one except when a billiondollar kaijus reputation is on the line,{},,"{""tags"":[""news""],""links"":[""https://filmdaily.co/obsessions/watch-godzilla-vs-kong-full-movie-2021-online-free-hbo-max/""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-08T19:42:33+00:00,52717147,

,deutsch,isabellaklais,achtung-gruene-trojanische-pferde-aus-wild-west,Achtung! Grüne Trojanische Pferde aus Wild West!,isabella klais departure we for germany for many they still stand for environmental protection and peace the greenlings but that has changed for a long time the partys founder petra kelly already showed strong us references which her last name indicated against the background of the highly interesting explanations of our friend erasmus consul the question arises whether the greenlings were not even a product made in the usa from the start this party has a particularly large number of figures with crime files and professionally failed existence rich fish grounds for foreign forces to gain fatal influence via extortion or corruption in germany their intellectual inferiority intuitively triggers endemic hatred of endemic hatred in germany this makes the party dangerous for our country the ruin of which was prepared by angela kasner and would be completed by the grnlingen which is why they have to be combated by all means erasmus consuls closing set shows the way it has to get worse so that it can be good the usa and its spearhead in germany and europe the green party from erasmus consul from the american area there was recently a publicationalthough certainly not from the field of the press of the establishment the deep politicalideological congruence between the green party and the ecologically charged and upgraded human rights imperialism with a penchant for permanent military interventionism of bidding administration shown an interesting consideration that has so far been dedicated too little attention after all the usa are right and the green links however these old stereotypes from the times of the cold war have long since been no longer because the agreement of the greens and the united states not only affects foreign policy but also has strongly domestic political implications such as the tendency to gender dictation the tendency towards the minority caroalition from the rainbow area of sexual minorities colored and minorities of all kinds in which the almost complete sexlessness or creation of artificial new gender forms have been introduced as a newer variant in recent years which are then to be enforced in everyday language not to mention the question of immigration where joe biden and the greens complement each other as well as they are both close to george soros the fact that the bll foundation as the thinking tanker of the greens publishes a paper on its homepage in which a departure from the sole law of the un security council for the mandating of international lawcompliant military missions is almost normal this normality also fits that when the transatlantic calls dare in addition to the relevant organizational organizational providers the bll foundation in addition to the relevant organizational providers such as the management of the munich security conference or the atlantic bridge this is still remarkable for some press organs if one is invoiced by the deeply pro american definition of german interests in this paper it seems hardly surprising since natos war actions against the then serbia under milosevic pro american and interventionist position of the greens has been one since long established attitude which the then foreign minister joschka fischer has already initiated by making it socially socially acceptable in the possibly more pacific of the vnsi cherheitrats council dispenses which is why among other things veteran diplomats of the external office resisted this procedure with the argument of violation of international law today there are probably no voices in the venerable office the greens did not prevent the greens from advocating nato intervention not even in the approval of the participation of german armed forces which they joined in the government at the time from the perspective of washington they may have passed their baptism of fire with the choice of joe biden in november it was already apparent so to speak it was expected that the new democratic us leadership would now endeavor to bring together a worldwide coalition of advanced forces the main objectives of which climate and environmental protection human rights and the spread of democracy should be on a worldwide scale president biden made it clear in his speech at the security conference in munich it is about a turning point in the struggle of democracy against autocracy he said accordingly it is clear that the united states again wants to underpin and ideologically go on the offensive at the same time the associated worldview with international relationships and international law is evident that the state sovereignty has to withdraw behind the ideological claim interference is now allowed when it comes to saving human rights and probably also the climate then you can then call the head of state of another country killer as biden recently done with putin again an idologique renversement now the ideological offensive is no longer from russia or china but from the west according to the motto who is not for us is against us the green combat force is at the forefront the described internationalist ideology is also part of its green worldview it is not for nothing that the sharpest comments on the alleged human rights violations against uigures the nawalnij case come against the baltic sea pipeline etc you name it as the anglo saxons say from the greens regardless of whether these are in berlin or vienna human rights and climate protection often combine great if you can criticize the baltic sea pipeline because of the associated human rights question as well as for its promotion on carbon based energy sources the residual elements of old socialist regulatory rage can be blindingly combined with anti capitalist reflexes against the evil economy of course it is not to be expected that joe biden and his democrats will support all radical visions of green environmental cup cocalyptists but their ideas fit perfectly into the washingtons foreign policy strategy and at least if they do not even damage them the german economy and thus their competition with the usa it is noticeable that the greens are more or less advocated for everything that makes life difficult for the economy in germany and central europe fast exit from nuclear energy and at the same time disability of sufficient gas deliveries via the baltic sea pipeline fight against a german key industry the auto industry partial technology lively support of sanctions of all kinds against countries that represent sales markets for the german economy it seems to me to consider the anglo saxon side that the germans could think about a new edition of the slogan partnership in leadership which is circulating in the and gain a new world recording in this way this may be the case in one or the other atlantic more closely close to the cducsu the greens are probably in their mass of thinking about any kind of german interests in this respect also ideal partners for the atlantic leadership for them the almost political genetic anti german self hatred the total dedication to universalist ideas is far too strong the constellation described could stimulate to think about whose creation is the so called green party especially in germanic realms it is not a purely german phenomenon you look at relevant statements by the austrian greens on russia to china which certainly delight the heart of every brave struggle in langley in their current expression the greens are really only an expression of political dementia of a wealthy bourgeoisie which could be viewed as a crowning glory of a lifelong late stadolescent immature aged eight sixties or has someone also indulged in a political creationism to whom this movement came with its programmed national self hatred sales fall to the bomber sepp when he converted his originally rather sandalarmed greens to the crashfully defensive defense of human rights in belgrade and the surrounding area so to speak rewritten from paul to a kind of saul from then on was allowed to be their lap dog and give expensive lectures in princeton a lot must have been washed down or rinsed away if you as a former stone thrower who is also said to have cheered in the false speech of the speech of a yassir arafat in his youth comes in such an honor joschka fs past leaves som it suggest that he was always a saul only the warlords and opponents changed why non olet is not wrong but you could also think of political survival questions here if you are inspired by what you may have stored about the former foreign minister with his dazzling past or do this and the new ideas of the greens on military interventions and their internationalist justification were certainly perceived as inspiring in washington in any case it remains worthwhile to take a look at this grown connection between the usa and the greens this point should also be paid to this point from the other side of the atlantic in the sense described a connection between black and green made sense the dream team of the atlantic so to speak for that long the mucus lane of heiko m after washington cannot become so that he could or want to further so consistently to weaken through anti corona measures this dream coalition may remain the only realistic and if the hopeful youngsters of the management of this party continues to consume so quickly with rapidly decreasing semi level times then as chance would remain so on another young lady that we have experienced for far too long ends to realize your dream but a few more months pass by september the economic situation with the consequences of lockdown policy could drive completely different political flowers that also have potential to get the greens in their way ,"{""profile"":{""website"":""http://www.aufbruch-wir-fuer-deutschland.de"",""location"":""Germany"",""about"":""Oppositionelle politische Bewegung"",""name"":""Aufbruch-Wir für

nederlandse versie fast furious volledige film belgi versiefilm is a streaming media streaming media is multimedia that is constantly received by and presented to an enduser while being delivered by a provider the verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium rather than the medium itself distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming eg radio television streaming apps or inherently nonstreaming eg books video cassettes audio cds there are challenges with streaming content on the internet for example users whose internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops lags or slow buffering of the content and users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content live streaming is the delivery of internet content in realtime much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal live internet streaming requires a form of source media eg a video camera an audio interface screen capture software an encoder to digitize the content a media publisher and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point although it frequently is streaming is an alternative to file downloading a process in which the enduser obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it through streaming an enduser can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted the term streaming media can apply to media other than video and audio such as live closed captioning ticker tape and realtime text which are all considered streaming text elevator music was among the earliest popular music available as streaming media nowadays internet television is a common form of streamed media some popular streaming services include netflix disney hulu prime video the video sharing website youtube and other sites which stream films and television shows apple music youtube music and spotify which stream music and the video game live streaming site twitch copyright copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work usually for a limited time the creative work may be in a literary artistic educational or musical form copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work but not the idea itself a copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations such as the fair use doctrine in the united states some jurisdictions require fixing copyrighted works in a tangible form it is often shared among multiple authors each of whom holds a set of rights to use or license the work and who are commonly referred to as rights holders these rights frequently include reproduction control over derivative works distribution public performance and moral rights such as attribution copyrights can be granted by public law and are in that case considered territorial rights this means that copyrights granted by the law of a certain state do not extend beyond the territory of that specific jurisdiction copyrights of this type vary by country many countries and sometimes a large group of countries have made agreements with other countries on procedures applicable when works cross national borders or national rights are inconsistent typically the public law duration of a copyright expires to years after the creator dies depending on the jurisdiction some countries require certain copyright formalities to establishing copyright others recognize copyright in any completed work without a formal registration in general many believe that the long copyright duration guarantees the better protection of works however several scholars argue that the longer duration does not improve the authors earnings while impeding cultural creativity and diversity on the contrast a shortened copyright duration can increase the earnings of authors from their works and enhance cultural diversity and creativity movies or film movies or films are a type of visual communication which uses moving pictures and sound to tell stories or teach people something most people watch view movies as a type of entertainment or a way to have fun for some people fun movies can mean movies that make them laugh while for others it can mean movies that make them cry or feel afraid it is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity however parc argues that contrary to prevailing beliefs imitation and copying do not restrict cultural creativity or diversity but in fact support them further this argument has been supported by many examples such as millet and van gogh picasso manet and monet etc most movies are made so that they can be shown on screen in cinemas and at home after movies are shown in cinemas for a period of a few weeks or months they may be marketed through several other medias they are shown on pay television or cable television and sold or rented on dvd disks or videocassette tapes so that people can watch the movies at home you can also download or stream movies older movies are shown on television broadcasting stations a movie camera or video camera takes pictures very quickly usually at or pictures frames every second when a movie projector a computer or a television shows the pictures at that rate it looks like the things shown in the set of pictures are really moving sound is either recorded at the same time or added later the sounds in a movie usually include the sounds of people talking which is called dialogue music which is called the soundtrack and sound effects the sounds of activities that are happening in the movie such as doors opening or guns being fired in the century the camera used photographic film the product is still often called a film even though there usually is no film a genre is a word for a type of movie or a style of movie movies can be fictional made up or documentary showing real life or a mix of the two although hundreds of movies are made every year there are very few that do not follow a small number of set plots or stories some movies mix together two or more genres action movies have a lot of exciting effects like car chases and gun fights involving stuntmen they usually involve goodies and baddies so war and crime are common subjects action movies usually need very little effort to watch since the plot is normally simple for example in die hard terrorists take control of a skyscraper and ask for a big ransom in exchange for not killing the hostage workers one hero somehow manages to save everyone action movies do not usually make people cry but if the action movie is also a drama emotion will be involved adventure movies usually involve a hero who sets out on a quest to save the world or loved ones animated movies use artificial images like talking cartoons to tell a story these movies used to be drawn by hand one frame at a time but are now made on computers buddy movies involve heroes one must save the other both must overcome obstacles buddy movies often involve comedy but there is also some emotion because of the close friendship between the buddies comedies are funny movies about people being silly or doing unusual things or being in silly or unusual situations that make the audience laugh documentaries are movies that are or claim to be about real people and real events they are nearly always serious and may involve strongly emotional subjects for example cruelty dramas are serious and often about people falling in love or needing to make a big decision in their life they tell stories about relationships between people they usually follow a basic plot where one or two main characters each actor plays a character have to overcome get past an obstacle the thing stopping them to get what they want tragedies are always dramas and are about people in trouble for example a husband and wife who are divorcing must each try to prove to a court of law that they are the best person to take care of their child emotion feelings are a big part of the movie and the audience people watching the movie may get upset and even cry film noir movies are detective dramas about crime and violence family movies are made to be good for the entire family they are mainly made for children but often entertaining for adults as well disney is famous for their family movies horror movies use fear to excite the audience music lighting and sets manmade places in movie studios where the movie is made are all designed to add to the feeling romantic comedies romcoms are usually love stories about people from different worlds who must overcome obstacles to be together romcoms are usually lighthearten but may include some emotion comedy horror movies blend horror and comic motifs in its plots movies in this genre sometimes use black comedy as the main form of humor science fiction movies are set in the future or in outer space some use their future or alien settings to ask questions about the meaning of life or how we should think about life science fiction movies often use special effects to create images of alien worlds outer space alien creatures and spaceships fantasy movies include magical and impossible things that any real human being cannot do thrillers are usually about a mystery strange event or crime that needs to be solved the audience is kept guessing until the final minutes when there are usually twists in the plot surprises suspense movies keep you on the edge of your seat they usually have multiple twists that confuse the watcher western movies tell stories about cowboys in the western united states in the and they are usually action movies but with historical costumes some involve native americans not all films that are set in the american west are made there for example western films made in italy are called spaghetti westerns some films can also use western plots even if they are set in other places tv movie the first television shows were experimental sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the televised events such as the summer olympics in germany the coronation of king george vi in the uk and david sarnoffs famous introduction at the new york worlds fair in the us spurred a growth in the medium but world war ii put a halt to development until after the war the world movie inspired many americans to buy their first television set and then in the popular radio show texaco star theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show earning host milton berle the name mr television and demonstrating that the medium was a stable modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers the first national live television broadcast in the us took place on september when president harry trumans speech at the japanese peace treaty conference in san francisco was transmitted over atts transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets the first national color broadcast the tournament of roses parade in the us occurred on january during the following ten years most network broadcasts and nearly all local programming continued to be in blackandwhite a color transition was announced for the fall of during which over half of all network primetime programming would be broadcast in color the first allcolor primetime season came just one year later in the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color resulting in the first completely allcolor network season formats and genres see also list of genres film and television formats and genres television shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented a show may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or nonfictional as in documentary news and reality television it may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some madefortelevision films or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional movie they could be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows a drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting the program follows their lives and adventures before the shows except for soap operatype serials typically remained static without story arcs and the main characters and premise changed little if some change happened to the characters lives during the episode it was usually undone by the end because of this the episodes could be broadcast in any order since the many movie feature progressive change in the plot the characters or both for instance hill street blues and st elsewhere were two of the first american prime time drama television movie to have this kind of dramatic structure while the later movie babylon further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended fiveseason run in it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies revenues than film some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs in academyawardwinning film director steven soderbergh commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative stated i think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television thanks for all and happy watching find all the movies that you can stream online including

woke up this morning because the bladder was fully charged i immediately moved from the bed to the bathroom before the wastewater in my body was released i first pushed the water and then i flushed to the floor this method is to reduce the smell of bathroom urine thats the wife said after i put the dipper on the walls of the water tub the waste water starts out of course as you guys too how nice it is to issue something that the body does not need right my mind floated between sleepiness that had not been completely lost and what obligations should i do this morning from the outside there was a crowing of the chicken stinging i smiled to myself they also seem to be in the contest after all the waste out in the body i flushed a few dipper then i took a brush and toothpaste i washed the brush first then i apply a little toothpaste i rinhed and brushed began to play cheerfully into my mouth hands move as you often do of course usually to do a clean cleaning i do not install a deadline when it must be two minutes or more or less than that i only use flavor parameters when i felt my mouth was comfortable thats when i stopped the movement of brushing my teeth after finishing my toothbrush then i took the prayer water starting with two palms ended watering the feet only limited to the ankles then i pray at dawn i live in a high school dormitory in my district approximately meters east of the city of banda aceh and this week there are only class xii children at school they are in the final school exam they are the dawn prayers in congregation in the musala which is located approximately meters north of our house to go to our musala the day down from a small hill whose height reaches or meters from the position of the musala even today even though this morning it didnt rain i was rather lazy to congregate in the musala wib i took a book from yesterday and even last night i read the first book muhammad rajab as a child in the village mademoiselle fifi by guy de maupassant and women in the land of serambi by rinal sahputra i havent finished reading the subtitles of fasting muhammad rajabs book his wife said that our underwear was on all dirty cloth shelves principal pandan thats right i thought i woke up and headed for the bathroom at the bathroom door we put a dirty cloth basket i set aside underwear into the bucket then i brought it to the kitchen i filled the bucket of percent of the water and then i put two liquid detergent sachets in the kitchen room besides there is a small table for a gas stove nearby we made a water shower for washing dishes and washing underwear because my wife is sick the underwear of the three of us i washed while the clothes we use everyday we use laundry services i havent washed my own clothes for a long time if counted even though only a few pieces of underwear but my breath until i struggled try if you use soap its definitely longer fortunately behind the house there is a large drill well when the laundry is finished i will brush i just open the faucet and rinse our underwear after that i brought back the house to the clothesline the only one i took underwear in the bucket i speeded up once or two then i took part in the clothesline the water speed of the water is enough to make the body uncomfortable this time not only me the men who are married are also reminded of the wifes efforts every day to produce clothes that are ready to wear usually i just need to take it in the closet whether it is drawstring singlet pants and clothes yes just wear it no matter how many pairs of clothes we use everyday hm starting today i have to save on clothes after everything was dried in the sun then i had breakfast today days before fasting since monday i have been off because my name has no list of school final exam supervisors while accompanying the child who was watching his favorite cartoon on a laptop i wrote this note for you hopefully it doesnt make you sad because you have to read this short note now the hour points to wib greetings half hot,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://img.esteem.ws/v1kcjeid23.jpg)"",""location"":""Aceh, Indonesia"",""about"":""orang kampung

man who wakes up one day in the body of a young orphan who inherited a store of his parents he receives a message a while after indicating that the system has been synchronized but in this world of martial cultivators warriors and sorcerers his system tells him that his function is to manage a coffeeinternet yes a cybercafe in a world of growers a novel of a certain absurd humor adventures classic videogames and the rise of the cybercafe manager who will become the sacred land of all the powers of his world chapter something does not feel good not only elves and orcs but also dwarves human wizards murderers and gentlemen were watching the new movie they did not understand very well what the film was about but they believed that all the products of this store were of the best quality therefore people who saw the avengers in the new store included not only old players but many new customers is this the movie that was said to have an evil god in the new store there were some noble ladies who loved the stories of gentlemen one of them had curly hair wine and wore an aristocratic long dress the badge that was wearing the chest showed that it was not an ordinary noble lady since the stars that rose from the clouds recorded in the badge could only be seen among the real members of the empire of the morning light young men and women sitting around them obviously also had a high range this was your first visit here yesterday they heard everyone talk about the movie today driven by curiosity each bought a membership and activated the avengers now they were seeing loki to make their appearance ah they shouted instantly they were so scared by the scene that their pants almost wet unlike the players of old stores rookies who had never seen such films almost go crazy imagine the scenario in which a mortal stopped before a real evil god who could scare them with a little of his presence the system had perfected every detail of the film according to the legends of this world the gods were so afraid that they could turn humans into ashes with a movement of their hands this evil god ah ah the aristocrats without talent who knew nothing more than observing the gentlemen shouted as soon as they saw this evil god even some orcs swallowed their saliva with difficulty the plot of the avengers was quite simple after the malignant god loki took the tesseract strongly the shield organization planned to gather the superheroes to handle this mess although it was simple this plot caused the story to be easy to understand for new customers who had never seen movies of this type before soon the heroes made their appearances this woman looks like an common person the audience observed and commented on black widow but its pretty commented an orco with a lions head but what is the use of beauty when fighting an evil god they thought then they saw the second superhero this guy is also an common person the audience scrutinized hulk who was in his human form how do i feel no special ability from them you even are afraid of a gun sala who had seen resident evil felt he was going to die this is the least powerful weapon this iron man seems to be an common person too naively the elves looked at iron man who was in a strange armor puaj does your feet spit fire the elves orcs and aristocrats observed perplexity how iron man fired to heaven on an extremely prosperous city like a fleeting star under the night sky the neon lights of the city flash like starry lights which dizzy the public that was not familiar with this style of high buildings the nighttime view of this city is impressive despite its fear of the evil god the elves fans of natural beauty still enjoyed the nighttime then they saw captain america this captain america does not seem powerful either an orco commented with a muted voice can these humans defeat this evil god in a battle then the spectators looked at the evil god while teleporting and used all kinds of destructive spells that the system had improved at a divine level they were impressed by their quiet and unique air as if i had everything under control a set of armor of strange shapes appeared in lokis body and left with casual steps as if he were walking in a park but the people around him were so scared that they rushed to flee obviously in the films system version the audience could feel better divine pressure without a scandal all humans before him knelt while trembling they submitted to the terrible power of this evil god all spectators could feel this horrible pressure this can humans really fight against such existence has this evil god recovered his divine power i feel that it is becoming stronger isnt this simpler the audience in the new store stopped between the crowd while seeing loki pronounce their proud speech isnt this your natural state it is the tacit truth of humanity that you yearn for subjugation in the end you will always kneel finally an old man stood out trembling and said no men like you loki made fun of look at your older people the scepter in the hand of loki condensed a destructive pale blue light that is an example so destructive light shot like a bright blue ray of death ahhyaa it will die hes going to die the least brave elves and humans covered their heads with their arms when they saw this fearsome evil god boom puaj a shy elf removed his fingers from his eyes and saw that the blue light bounced loki dropped to the ground and was silent for a long time captain america stood before the old man with a small round shield in his hand then a ray of light similar to a rocket flew from the sky two rays of blindness with great energy of the nuclear reactor fired from the center of two hands make your movement when the horrible evil god tried to move again iron man stopped in front of him yes hey ah what is happening isnt it an evil god the public who had been frozen with fear seemed bewildered how does this plot feel suspicious this captain america does not seem powerful but what is the trick with his shield that iron man does not look different from a common soldier apart from his metal armor but what were the rays of light that instantly knocked down the evil god i dont like it in the movie captain america opened his mouth and spoke what stone age gave up so easily is this a plan upon hearing his conversation the audience felt uncomfortable again i also feel that things cant be so simple they had seen lokis tranquility as if he had everything under control even though he was captured by these humans it seemed that everything was planning and humans had no power to resist slow corrosion this feeling even suffocated the orcs and dwarves much less the elves this evil god must have been delivered on purpose right the old sewell looked at the scene before her and commented this evil god is so cunning i feel that a horrible plan is elaborating you support me if you like my contribution

,hive-153503,pedrobrito2004,capitulo-714-sistema-de-cafe-internet-de-tecnologia-oscura,Capítulo 714 - Sistema de Café Internet de Tecnología Oscura, a chinese web novel tells the peculiar life of a man who wakes up one day in the body of a young orphan who inherited a store of his parents he receives a message a while after indicating that the system has been synchronized but in this world of martial cultivators warriors and sorcerers his system tells him that his function is to manage a coffeeinternet yes a cybercafe in a world of growers a novel of a certain absurd humor adventures classic videogames and the rise of the cybercafe manager who will become the sacred land of all the powers of his world chapter a simple story about heroes in the city that was gradually becoming ruins the spectators looked up and saw giant warships flying from the huge hole in the sky even the lowest range soldiers used the horrible laser weapons that could pierce a scratch with blue light rays the chitauri said they were part of the immune system of the universe with the work of destroying chaos and free will which made them an evil nightmare legion they passed through the portal that was opened by the tesseract that was taken by loki and ran to the sky on the earth continuously with agile bodies as fish its spacecraft seemed huge whales of the ocean depths that could go back to heaven each of these spacecraft was as large as an aircraft carrier the terrifying thing was that these alien spacecraft equipped with alien technologies were no longer ordinary spacecraft in the imagination of humans the spaces of the spacecraft cut out open skyscrapers as if they were sharp knives that cut the tofu and its huge lines knocked down countless buildings such as dominoes these strange spacecraft looked like machines and ways of life at the same time and turned the city into a disaster like giant space beasts that rose in heaven sitting in small airplanes such as compact lobster groups their soldiers killed all living beings who saw destructive laser rays such as rain drops in a storm the six superheroes were under the portal obviously this film did not follow the traditional way of expressing history by putting the heroes at a disadvantage at the beginning instead the film showed the great powers of the heroes in a humorous way at this time the audience was amazed by humans in this land unconsciously how is humans in this earth are so powerful the elder dwarf sauk asked aloud there are many of them they were amazed by the unthinkable power that iron man obtained from the reactor in his chest or hulks pure and horrible physical strength which was greater than that of a god they had thought that thor who was a god should be the main force of the alliance but now they discovered that each of the heroes was a main force at this time the audience saw the heroes meet again to face the current crisis together even customers of the new store in canglan were delighted with the movie meanwhile they began to feel very curious about the past and the background of these heroes wondering what had made them so powerful at this time his fear for the evil god had vanished and instead there was a combination of fear and curiosity that modern people felt while watching horror movies call it capi in the space emptiness behind the portal the nodriza ship which was often larger than these spacecraft was in deep darkness sending more and more spacecraft to the earth very good listen until we can close that portal up there we will use containment baton i love you on that roof eye in everything avisosos de patronos and eliminates lost stark you have the perimeter anything that comes out more than three blocks you turn it or turn it into ashes after these orders were issued it was thors turn you have to try that portal decrease the speed with which they arrive when the films climax arrived the audience of the other world was captivated hulk with a deafening and furious roar hulks huge body broke the ground like a huge cannon bullet then instantly he grabbed the soldiers of a flying ship in the sky the powerful rays of light sent by these flying ships could not even penetrate the skin of the green giant it seemed that nothing could block his enormous strength everything including metal rocks and spacecraft that transported the chitauri army was destroyed by its huge iron fists stunning clouds emerged in heaven while many rays formed a huge destructive network many rays that were as thick as cubes hit the portal brutally under the control of thors hammer exploiting the huge spacecraft that passed through the portal in the blink of an eye they became waves of clouds of fire while many debris of the spacecraft fell from the sky as fleeting stars the thunderous lights and flames in the sky seemed many radiant fireworks on the other hand hawkeye barton threw arrows exploiting the spacecraft in the sky and turning them into fireballs the flames and burning lights crossed the city causing explosive and artistic destruction everywhere this was absolutely a great visual feast for the enjoyment of eyes wow the elves dwarves and gentlemen discovered that they were completely captivated by the scenes of the war au au holding a large bag of fries he had bought in qzone jiang xiaoyue got a great handful of fries in his mouth while enjoying the avengers obviously as a player of one of the old stores he was quieter than the others but he was still fascinated by this novel and humorous film to his surprise another hand put his hand in the bag and grabbed a handful of fries xiaoyue this original taste is not so good why didnt you buy cucumber flavor mr fang said while chewing the fries you are saying that you dont know well after you finish eating jiang xiaoyue was upset you eat my fries every day at this time the war came to an end although many chitauri troops that had entered the earth through the portal had been destroyed the nodriza ship in a vacuum was still sending more spacecraft down as if there were an endless supply like black clouds more and more spacecraft surrounded hulk and poured rays of light on him even the reactor energy could not last long in a war on such a large scale tony stark iron man discovered that he had little energy after destroying several spacecraft of the chitauri army that seemed huge beasts at this time the military activated the most frightful weapon a white missile flew to the city with a long tail of escape flames like a rocket it was a nightmare for humans and their enemies produced by a much more advanced technology than the world where fang qi had lived before traveling through space and time this nuclear missile had much greater power all both humans and their enemies would be destroyed seeing iron man approaching the missile on his own and pushing him to change the trajectory before driving it to the other side of the portal the audience seemed to begin to understand what the word hero meant maybe it was a first leg which was a price that an common person could not pay from humor to passion and then to heroism yes this was a simple story about heroes maybe it was just a very simple film about superheroes but its simplicity had many benefits at least everyone understood their humor and while they laughed they also understood the message that the film tried to convey on the other side of the portal the nuclear fusion turned the entire nodriza ship into a fire ocean annihilating it in a vacuum hey this iron man is not yet dead the elves

brought it to the kitchen i filled the bucket of percent of the water and then i put two liquid detergent sachets in the kitchen room besides there is a small table for a gas stove nearby we made a water shower for washing dishes and washing underwear because my wife is sick the underwear of the three of us i washed while the clothes we use everyday we use laundry services i havent washed my own clothes for a long time if counted even though only a few pieces of underwear but my breath until i struggled try if you use soap its definitely longer fortunately behind the house there is a large drill well when the laundry is finished i will brush i just open the faucet and rinse our underwear after that i brought back the house to the clothesline the only one i took underwear in the bucket i speeded up once or two then i took part in the clothesline the water speed of the water is enough to make the body uncomfortable this time not only me the men who are married are also reminded of the wifes efforts every day to produce clothes that are ready to wear usually i just need to take it in the closet whether it is drawstring singlet pants and clothes yes just wear it no matter how many pairs of clothes we use everyday hm starting today i have to save on clothes after everything was dried in the sun then i had breakfast today days before fasting since monday i have been off because

,aaa,drax,film-review-meteor-1979,Film Review: Meteor (1979), hollywood disaster films were made before and after but the genre is usually associated with that particular decade when combination of special effects intense action and starstudded casts almost guaranteed boxoffice success decline of the genre occurred when this formula lost its effectiveness and by chance this decline coincided with the end of the decade one of the clearest examples of such decline can be found in meteor science fiction film directed by ronald neame the calamity threatening the protagonists in this film tops everything seen before a comet travelling through solar system has struck an asteroid smashing it into million pieces the largest one being five miles wide and on collision course to earth bound to end civilisation or humanity on impact nominal protagonist played by sean connery is dr paul bradley former nasa scientist who has designed hercules orbital nuclear weapons platform with the purpose of prevent this from happening he has resigned nasa disgusted with the way hercules was commandeered by us military into secret first strike asset against soviet union now he is called by government to help redirect the missiles against the asteroid but it turns out that destructive power of those missiles isnt enough thankfully soviets have their own orbital weapons platform and their missiles combined with american ones might just do the job soviet scientist dr dubov played by brian keith and his translator tatiana donska played by natalie wood arrive into secret underground base in new york to help bradley and his colleagues in the meantime pieces of asteroid begins to hit earth causing avalanche in switzerland and tsunami that wrecks hong kong while the even larger piece threatens to hit new york directed by ronald neame british film maker known for the poseidon adventure undisputed classic of disaster film genre meteor cant escape comparisons with the film that used the same premise with much more success this film unlike michael bays messy combination of cheap melodrama and cheap comedy plays it straight and the script unlike michael bays ode to american chauvinism shows the importance of international cooperation and that even cold war adversaries must overcome their differences for the sake of humanity this is however the only advantage meteor has over armageddon in everything else it represents dismal failure the script is filled with onedimensional characters including paranoid us general going mad over having to allow evil communists into his base played hysterically by martin landau the plot generally leaves overqualified charismatic actors nothing to do but talk nonsense and stare at screens hardly anything happens in the film and when it finally does the film which had higher budget than star it becomes obvious that almost nothing went into special effects which consequently look pathetically unconvincing even for late standards one such example is destruction of new york presented through more than obvious stock footage of buildings going through controlled demolition meteor unsurprisingly fared very badly both at the boxoffice and at the critics nowadays it can be recommended only to those viewers curious enough to see how could a disaster film can end as a disaster itself rating blog in croatian blog in english leofinance blog

,b,stopask,3jglat,为什么没有所谓的客观现实,in the next few minutes i hope to change the way you think about the very nature of reality itself im not a physicist and im not a philosopher im a historian and after studying the ancient greeks and many other premodern peoples for more than years as a professional ive become convinced that they all lived in real worlds very different from our own now of course you and i here today we take it for granted that theres just one ultimate reality out there our reality a fixed universal world of experience ruled by timeless laws of science and nature but i want you to see things differently i want you to see that humans have always lived in a pluriverse of many different worlds not in a universe of just one and if youre willing to see this pluriverse of many worlds it will fundamentally change i hope the way you think about the human past and hopefully the present and the future as well now lets get started by asking three basic questions about the contents of our reality the real world that you and i share right here right now first of all what is it that makes something real in our real world well for us real things are material things things made of matter that we can somehow see like atoms people trees mountains planets by the same token invisible immaterial things like gods and demons heavens and hells these are considered unreal theyre simply beliefs subjective ideas that exist only in the realm of the mind to be real a thing must exist objectively in some visible material form whether our minds can perceive it or not second what are the most important things in our real world answer human things people cities societies cultures government economies why is this well because we humans think were special we think were the only creatures on the planet who have things like language reason free will by contrast nonhuman things to us are just part of nature a mere backdrop to human culture a mere environment of things that we feel entitled to use however we want and third what does it mean to be a human in our real world well it means being an individual a person who lives ultimately for oneself we think nature has made us this way giving each and every one of us all of the reason the right the freedom and the selfinterest to thrive and compete with other individuals for all of lifes important resources but im suggesting to you that this real world of ours is neither timeless nor universal its just one of countless different real worlds that humans have experienced in history what then would another world look like well lets look at one the real world of the classical athenians in ancient greece now of course we usually know the athenians as our cultural ancestors pioneers of our western traditions philosophy democracy drama and so forth but their real world was nothing like our own the real world of the athenians was alive with things that we would consider immaterial and thus unreal it pulsated with things like gods spirits nymphs fates curses oaths souls and all kinds of mysterious energies and magical forces indeed the most important things in their real world were not humans at all but gods why because gods were awesome literally they controlled all the things that made life possible sunshine rainfall crop harvests childbirth personal health family wealth sea voyages battlefield victories there were over gods in athens and they were not remote detached divinities watching over human affairs from afar they were really there immediately there in experience living in temples attending sacrifices mingling with the athenians at their festivals banquets and dances and in the real world of the athenians humans did not live apart from nature their lives were dictated by the rhythms of the seasons and by the life cycles of crops and animals indeed the land of the athenians itself was not just a piece of property or territory it was a goddess a living goddess that had once given birth to the first athenians and had nurtured and cared for all of their descendants ever since with her precious gifts of soils water stone and crops indeed if anything should pollute her soils with unlawful bloodshed it had to be expelled immediately beyond her boundaries whether it was a man an animal or just a fallen roof tile and in the real world of the athenians there were no individuals all athenians were inseparable from their families and all athenian families were expected to live together and work together as a single body like cells of a living organism they called this social body simply demos the people and they called their way of life demokratia but it was nothing like our modern democracy because athenians were not born to be individuals living for themselves they were born to serve and preserve the families and the social body that had given them life in the first place in sum the whole athenian way of being human was radically different from our own nature had programmed them to live as one as a unitary social body and it had designed them expressly to coexist and collaborate with all manner of nonhuman beings especially their gods and their divine earth mother life in athens was thus sustained by what we can call a cosmic ecology a symbiotic ecology of gods motherland and people now of course to us today in our real world we look at their real world and well it looks strange weird bizarre exotic and of course unreal but it has many major things in common with the real world experienced by numerous other premodern peoples including for example the ancient egyptians ancient chinese and the peoples of precolonial peru mexico india bali hawaii in all of those premodern real worlds gods controlled all of the conditions of existence nonhumans were always expected to collaborate with humans and vice versa and humans were expected to serve their communities not to live for themselves as individuals indeed in the grand scheme of history its our real world our reality that is the great exception to the rule the exotic one the strange one only in our real world is reality itself a purely material order only in our real world are nonhumans always subordinate to humans and only in our real world are humans born to be individuals why this uniqueness well because our real world was shaped and forged in a unique environment a historically unprecedented environment in early modern europe with its scientific revolution its enlightenment its novel experimental capitalist way of life yet despite this uniqueness we just take it for granted that our reality is the one true reality that all humans in history have lived in only our real world whether they knew it or not and just think for a moment of the colossal arrogance of this assumption basically were saying we modern westerners are right about reality and everybody else in all of history is wrong basically were saying that all of those extraordinary civilizations of the past were really just lucky accidents because they were all founded on nothing more than myths illusions and false ideas about reality why are we so certain that were right why do we just take it for granted that we know more why do we struggle to take seriously the real worlds of premodern peoples well because we think our modern sciences provide the only truly objective knowledge of reality but do they for more than a hundred years now the very idea of an objective reality has been seriously and continually questioned by experts in many different fields from physics and biology to philosophy basically these experts would suggest that reality is not simply a material order given to us by nature it is something that humans actively participate in producing when their minds interact with their environment heres a way to think about it in order to make sense of experience every people in the past in effect had to devise a model of the real world they would then use that model as the basis for their whole way of life all of its practices its norms its values and if that way of life proved to be successful in practice sustainable then the truth of the model would be confirmed by the evidence of everyday experience it works and thus once the model became internalized in mind and baked into the environment the effect of a stable real world would be generated by ongoing interactions between the two between minds on the one hand environments on the other lets take a quick example why are we so convinced in our modern world that were all ultimately natural individuals well because a bunch of social scientists in early modern europe decided that we were and because their model of a world full of natural competitive individuals became the basis for a new capitalist way of life that generated unprecedented levels of wealth at least for the lucky few and because all of us whove been raised in capitalist nations ever since have been continually socialized to be individuals by our families our schools and our societies and because we are treated precisely as individuals almost every day of our lives by the structures which control those lives like our liberal democracy and our capitalist economy in other words our minds and our environment continually conspire to make our individuality seem entirely natural in sum no human being has ever experienced a truly objective reality different peoples have always experienced different realities each one shaped by whatever model of the world happened to be embedded in minds and environment at the time in other words humans have always lived in a pluriverse of many different real worlds not in a universe of just one let me close with three thoughts that follow from this conclusion first of all we modern westerners need to stop thinking that all premodern peoples are somehow more primitive or less enlightened than ourselves their real world with all their gods and magical forces were just as real as our own indeed those real worlds anchored ways of life that sustained the lives of multitudes for hundreds sometimes thousands of years their real worlds were different they were not wrong second we modern westerners need to get over ourselves laughter we need to be a little more humble for all of its extraordinary technological accomplishments our brave new modern real world has imperiled the whole future of the planet in barely years its made possible all manner of historical horrors genocides across entire continents mass exploitation of colonized peoples industrial servitude two disastrous world wars the holocaust nuclear warfare species extinctions environmental degradation factory farming and of course global warming the evidence is there if you want to see it our model of reality has failed catastrophically in practice third other models and other real worlds are possible other worlds are being lived right now as we speak in what remains of historys pluriverse in places like amazonia the andes southern mexico northern canada australia and all the other places where indigenous peoples are struggling to preserve their highly sustainable ancestral ways of life to prevent them being destroyed by modernitys everexpanding universe i suggest that all of these nonmodern peoples past and present have so much to teach us about living more sustainable lives in other possible worlds so lets start right now to try to learn from them before its too late lets try to magnify our imaginations lets start to imagine other possible ways of being human in other possible worlds thank you,{},,"{""tags"":[""b""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-09T13:33:51+00:00,52738374,
,hive-101145,sahan123,3rikac,한국의 문화, have you ever thought about how many different cultures in the world are there no culture will be equal they are all very specific in their own ways this kind of international state is korea the united states has the best date with korea after the international struggle ii and the korean war the united states is now peaceful with korea the relationship with the united states is just one of the many things that korea can offer in the united states s a from amazing physical ability exciting holidays and traditions and the authorities and economic systems this is one of the beautiful international places that can be simply inspected u s what we study is korea it is located on the asian continent under north korea and is located near japan and china korea is miles and the united states is miles this is about of california korea is so small but the population is about million in korea there are mountains in the east and there are many coastline and beaches in the south sadly many mountains and coastlines occupy through buildings and residences but nevertheless many mountains and coastlines can travel to this natural formation nevertheless despite the fact that herbs are formed around korea has begun to lose many herb resources due to over harvest some herbal assets are still round and grown like food but korea has been introduced in other international areas because it has removed these natural ingredients by building many factories and building houses on it it was harvested looking at the physical characteristics of korea korea has a very friendly climate throughout the four seasons spring and autumn are very short due to the temperature between summer and winter once again the summer is very humid hot long cold and dry in winter korea has the fourth largest financial system in the world in korea earned about trillion ppp in gross domestic product and in the companys income and assistance was changed to ppp most of the korean economy comes from institutions and companies made by humans many koreans in korea are doing business in any form instead of agriculture in general humans within the national state work with agriculture and livestock in general farmers grow barley wheat rice soybeans root vegetables and have livestock including cattle pigs and chickens it means that the united states has a president and prime minister the president of korea is park geun hye and the chief minister is hwang gyo an their judicial tool consists of koreas ultimate court document the constitutional court of korea transitional courts district courts relatives and administrative court records their military headquarters is in seoul south korea and the minister of protection is min koreas crime prices are also considered low now travel to koreas way of life and money vacation it is said that he received foreign currency for korea the united states was created in the after the end of the inter korean war the main language of korea is korean but other languages began to come out with english for example hangeul and hangul were created in to help the general public speak and write through king sejong the capital of korea is seoul like the capital seoul many cities are cities but that doesnt mean theres always a countryside most agricultural areas have many elderly people living and at the same time the city consists of many young people koreans spend a lot of exceptional foods the biggest ingredients they eat are kimchi and rice koreans eat rice for breakfast so they dont really eat traditional foods such as cereals pancakes eggs and baron barba berulam they also eat all kinds of seafood and eat disgusted foods one of the best elements of korea is that there are many places that deliver various kinds of meals to peoples homes and promote street ingredients the two big holidays in korea are chuseok koreas thanksgiving day and new years day or months of new years day in korea every year we meet our families and congratulate you through many specific styles on new years day we eat traditional food called tteokguk humans also play with laughter games chuseok usually eats a food called korean traditional rice cake that fills sesame seeds and honey but eats other ingredients with black beans green beans cinnamon pine nuts walnuts chestnuts and jujube trading with a friend at every vacation koreans pay homage to elders and ancestors and wear traditional costumes called hanbok and hanbok do uses brides and grooms to wear at a stage at a wedding each vacation does not have a specific date and is exchanged every year according to the lunar calendar in addition to that holiday there are many unique opportunities for koreans for example november is mile pepero day it is not really meaningful at this time but it is a pleasant day for pepero to sell and sell special discounts is november because it is the same as the pepero stick there are also a lot of meaningless but fun

,hive-101145,sahan123,3wfwqk,한국 문화, have you ever thought about how many different cultures in the world are there no culture will be equal they are all very specific in their own ways this kind of international state is korea the united states has the best date with korea after the international struggle ii and the korean war the united states is now peaceful with korea the relationship with the united states is just one of the many things that korea can offer in the united states s a from amazing physical ability exciting holidays and traditions and the authorities and economic systems this is one of the beautiful international places that can be simply inspected u s what we study is korea it is located on the asian continent under north korea and is located near japan and china korea is miles and the united states is miles this is about of california korea is so small but the population is about million in korea there are mountains in the east and there are many coastline and beaches in the south sadly many mountains and coastlines occupy through buildings and residences but nevertheless many mountains and coastlines can travel to this natural formation nevertheless despite the fact that herbs are formed around korea has begun to lose many herb resources due to over harvest some herbal assets are still round and grown like food but korea has been introduced in other international areas because it has removed these natural ingredients by building many factories and building houses on it it was harvested looking at the physical characteristics of korea korea has a very friendly climate throughout the four seasons spring and autumn are very short due to the temperature between summer and winter once again the summer is very humid hot long cold and dry in winter korea has the fourth largest financial system in the world in korea earned about trillion ppp in gross domestic product and in the companys income and assistance was changed to ppp most of the korean economy comes from institutions and companies made by humans many koreans in korea are doing business in any form instead of agriculture in general humans within the national state work with agriculture and livestock in general farmers grow barley wheat rice soybeans root vegetables and have livestock including cattle pigs and chickens it means that the united states has a president and prime minister the president of korea is park geun hye and the chief minister is hwang gyo an their judicial tool consists of koreas ultimate court document the constitutional court of korea transitional courts district courts relatives and administrative court records their military headquarters is in seoul south korea and the minister of protection is min koreas crime prices are also considered low now travel to koreas way of life and money vacation it is said that he received foreign currency for korea the united states was created in the after the end of the inter korean war the main language of korea is korean but other languages began to come out with english for example hangeul and hangul were created in to help the general public speak and write through king sejong the capital of korea is seoul like the capital seoul many cities are cities but that doesnt mean theres always a countryside most agricultural areas have many elderly people living and at the same time the city consists of many young people koreans spend a lot of exceptional foods the biggest ingredients they eat are kimchi and rice koreans eat rice for breakfast so they dont really eat traditional foods such as cereals pancakes eggs and baron barba berulam they also eat all kinds of seafood and eat disgusted foods one of the best elements of korea is that there are many places that deliver various kinds of meals to peoples homes and promote street ingredients the two big holidays in korea are chuseok koreas thanksgiving day and new years day or months of new years day in korea every year we meet our families and congratulate you through many specific styles on new years day we eat traditional food called tteokguk humans also play with laughter games chuseok usually eats a food called korean traditional rice cake that fills sesame seeds and honey but eats other ingredients with black beans green beans cinnamon pine nuts walnuts chestnuts and jujube trading with a friend at every vacation koreans pay homage to elders and ancestors and wear traditional costumes called hanbok and hanbok do uses brides and grooms to wear at a stage at a wedding each vacation does not have a specific date and is exchanged every year according to the lunar calendar in addition to that holiday there are many unique opportunities for koreans for example november is mile pepero day it is not really meaningful at this time but it is a pleasant day for pepero to sell and sell special discounts is november because it is the same as the pepero stick there are also a lot of meaningless but fun

,nuclear,syedrakib99,nuclear-power-plant,Nuclear power plant, nuclear power plants are a type of power plant that use the process of nuclear fission in order to generate electricity they do this by using nuclear reactors in combination with the rankine cycle where the heat generated by the reactor converts water into steam which spins a turbine and a generator nuclear power provides the world with around of its total electricity with the largest producers being the united states and france aside from the source of heat nuclear power plants are very similar to coalfired power plants however they require different safety measures since the use of nuclear fuel has vastly different properties from coal or other fossil fuels they get their thermal power from splitting the nuclei of atoms in their reactor core with uranium being the dominant choice of fuel in the world today thorium also has potential use in nuclear power production however it is not currently in use below is the basic operation of a boiling water power plant which shows the many components of a power plant along with the generation of electricity,{},,"{""tags"":[""nuclear"",""power"",""plant"",""electricity""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYKWRSa1xco7vA269CVxKZxyJp7hnVJPV8nWGN6kevCQj/BoilingWaterReactor.gif""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-09T15:08:39+00:00,52740254,

admin and moderators of this community belenguerra worldgeography brightobias and i really appreciate your hardworks in this entire steemit platform here are the strongest insects you may not know images cockroach download its somewhat amazing right yeah but that fact remains that cockroaches are wonderfully made a cockroach can live up to days without its head it can equally hold its breath for about minutes it can equally stay for up to a week without water and up to a month without food cockroaches are among the most adaptable creatures on earth and again it is believed that cockroaches can withstand massive radiation or nuclear blast than humans in other words cockroaches are difficult to die dung beetle images when it comes to strength in comparison to body weight the dung beetle is the strongest animal in the world is shocking right what this insect does bus that they will gather up the excrement of all kinds of animals roll it into massive balls and then transport these big circular meals to a burrow where a feast can be had they are really amazing creatures every insects are really special in their own ways leafcutter ant images like i said earlier all the insects are uniquely special ants are known for their strengths in relation with their body sizes this leafcutter ants are uniquely amazing because of the incredible strength they possesse in their neck they can carry times their weight in their mouths while carefully positioning their necks a group of leafcutter ants can carry things bigger than them like lizards frogs and so on froghopper images this insect is uniquely strong when it comes to insects with strong legs it has a good body shape conducive to jumping which is capable of jumping so if you are looking for the insect which is the strongest jumper the froghopper should be the first to come to your mind bumblebees images like the saying knowledge is power so i would equally classify bumblebees as one of the strongest insects not because of physical strength but by knowledge this insect may be the smartest insect on the planet bumblebees will engage in complex mathematics that even massive supercomputers struggle to consider all the elements and parameters of they can easily calculate how to get to the most flowers in the shortest amount of time when it comes to animals with smartness bumblebees deserves to win it mosquito images the mosquito is undoubtedly the most hated insect you might be wondering why this insect made the list right lolz its because when measuring the strength of insects by how many people it has killed the mosquito will definitely win among all the insects in the world regardless of their sizes and looks the mosquito has killed more humans than any other insect with over million deaths due to how it spreads the fatal disease known as malaria they spread malaria through their process of biting and feeding upon humans with the world health organization finding that every year over million cases are reported of malaria so i guess that is the more reason the mosquito is the hated conclusion let me stop here i hope it was interesting reading through it and i hope to constantly bring you some interesting and amazing facts about animals and plants cc stephenkendal thank you

,gaming,rolsonpatison,43goew-gameeit-the-first-steemit-magazine-about-gaming-and-technology-no-1,Gameeit - The first Steemit magazine about gaming and technology. No.1, the magazine was translated from polish here is the original version table of contents a word of introduction vatsim review donkey kong country tropical freeze review stardew valley the era of nintendo google vr hit or kitsch cultural corner once it was the final word a hello here it is the first steemit gaming magazine when i was young i used to buy similar magazines once i dreamed to become such editor steemit gives me an opportunity to make this dream come true i will say straight away that this magazine is made by me from a scratch thats why its totally amateurish and it may slightly differ in quality from the magazines that you can find at newsstand it also wont be a multipage magazine because i dont have whole editorial office under my command i only have a head a computer and some ideas there may appear some error in the graphics or text although of course it will be checked before publication this is only the first number of the magazine so if need come i will learn from my mistakes fonts and pictures are on free license for commercial use screenshots from games are made by me i invite you to my world world of games technology news and a handful of retro memories we are going to taste some culture too i will try to review games add announcements and collaborate with readers if they will be you dont like games ive got cultural corner for you in which you find propositions of books tv series and music gameeit ultimately will not be only about games but i will also discuss subjects around games i encourage you to write letters you can send them by email magazyngameeitgmailcom and i will publish them in the next magazine number so lets go whats the loudest premieres of the month are state of decay which will appear on may and detroit become human days later though everyone is looking at los angeles anyway this begins on june although it is preceded by the ea conference which starts on june this is where well get to know the details about upcoming games for consoles and personal computers there are going to be announcements of completely new titles for sure as well as trailers and dates of games premiere which we are already expecting most likely we are going to see trailer of new tomb rider rage or sequel of the crew surely on ea conference as always we will see the next edition of fifa but also madden and nba live while fifa has a lot of fans in europe there are almost no madden players at all when it comes to basketball then dont kid yourself ea on this field is not holding a candle to its competitor from nintendo fans are counting on new pokmon or metroid prime but its a large question mark anyway i think that these fairs are going to be great and there will be a lot of gaming emotions the greatest mystery is games for pc it could be very interesting because every now and then comes out a hit on a lol or fortnite scale will the fairs bring us a title that will attract large numbers of players in front of the monitors we will see but there is a potential for sure conference schedule central europe time ea june pm microsoft june pm bethesda june am ubisoft june pm sony june am nintendo june pm technology is moving forward when i heard about vatsim i couldnt get over that such tool exist this software gives realistic feeling of being a pilot or flight controller i dont have any screenshots from this simulator because i dont feel competent person to even try to play with it and i dont want to steal them from others operating on this simulator is too difficult because flying the plane is also difficult its not enough that we have to start the machine but before we have to contact another player in this case who is flight controller and of course fuel our plane imagine that vatsim uses exactly the same maps weather data as real aviation in addition the procedures for takeoff flight landing and contact with the controller are respected identically here often the future pilots learn the secrets of this work we get a perfectly mapped cockpit and we must not only be able to rise into the air but also choose the right flight path operate the dampers that are responsible for the movement of the aircraft know english language because its the basis in aviation and in the simulator we will communicate in such language simply youre like a real pilot in front of the screen of the monitor you complete all the procedures that govern real aviation you need to know every button in the cockpit there is no place for any arbitrariness you are a pilot not trevor from gta who steals the plane and fly by only operating one knob on the pad it is extremely shocking how perfectly pilots job can be shown even an increasingly popular pilot from youtube channel turbulencja mentioned about vatsim and thats a huge recommendation when we finally done connecting joysticks not pads turn off the lights connect three monitors ah ive been lost in daydreaming it is a pity that this plane from gta is still more accessible fans of aerial games will also be interested in the microsoft flight simulator or world of warplanes even though vatsim is fascinating without a huge aviation knowledge there is no point in taking it anyway i am waiting for a real simulator of some fast car i wonder if someday technology will give me the opportunity to smell the exhaust fumes when i received my copy of the game from the store the seller mentioned that it sells well probably because of hehe first holy communion gifts if at least one eightyearold child manages to finish this game hats off another adventure of a cheerful monkey is in fact a version from wii u slightly improved and released on nintendo switch donkey kong is already a gaming icon just like link or mario that is why it is always taken very warmly especially in such fantastic audiovisual binding but first things first the game is taking us to the jungle where a lot of adventures await us with the help of several friends our monkey will defeat small big or even large bosses we will collect bananas to use save in search of a very well hidden puzzle we will cross the most difficult level locations we can also fly and swim the jump mechanics is fantastic adversities in the game are not random and if something goes wrong and it will happen very often we can only blame ourselves not game producers there are a lot of traps from spikes through various monsters extremely difficult traps and on big bosses ending the further you get into the forest or rather the jungle the harder it is there are situations in which it can be hard and frustrating do not be fooled on on the cover that suggest that this game is intended for children from the age of i agree that in this game there is no violence sex or drugs so from this angle its affordable for everyone however a child without parents help could not cope with this title but we older players love such a gaming masochism we like to repeat levels so that we can finally succeed i think i know why this number of a magazine is being made so long a lot of profanity came out from my mouth what is more i wanted to collect all things from the level the game is incredibly diverse in addition to flying or swimming well take a roller coaster or a rhinoceros this is a real ride without a stick when the trolley speed up it will be extremely difficult for us to get all the pickups on the map in addition to the puzzles to pass the level at we have to get all the letters from the inscription kong such adding of difficulties is extremely satisfying audiovisual binding is a masterpiece the graphics is beautiful although it could not be seen on the screenshots it is a matter of an embarrassing image transfer between the console and the computer however i guarantee you will be delighted especially in portable mode the heroes are created in the highest quality level design is even better than in rayman legends which i was charmed its better because they are more diverse the various environments on which our monkey moves build a great atmosphere and receiving graphic impressions makes this game unique here weve got fixed frames per second without drops it could be very well seen during moving by trolley music here is mastery its something that weve already got used to because earlier versions of donkey kong a good recommendation will be when i would say that this is david wises job who worked on previous donkey kong games it is beautifully matched and as well as levels diverse and at the same time always impressive i have some regret to the creators about the lack of a cooperative game mode you could use two joycons and play with your friends but they didnt implement such mode as far as i like hardcore games and high level of difficulty it will not be a good product for children here you need to experience this type of games and a lot of patience it is still a great platformer that resembles the best memories from the times of the popular pegasus console its the same climate in a wonderful setting i recommend it to everyone overal rating although the game has already been released some time ago its worth coming back to it because it just goes on ps vita have you ever wanted to break free from the whirl of everyday school or business duties and live on a farm plant melons or go fishing now you have an opportunity just like a hero of this game who quits his devastating job and in the legacy after grandfather he gets a plot stardew valley is a game which is created by one person as soon as it was released it conquered twitch and youtube gaming but this trend did not last so long its a pity because the game is fantastic especially for older players who still remember harvest moon a game from psx and nintendo consoles where weve got our own farm stardew valley offers much more there are so many things to do that you dont really know what to do at the very beginning we get to the yard because its hard to call it a farm there are just stones and weeds plus a tiny wooden shack in order to plant something on this farm it is necessary to clean the area so we chop the trees and dig some stones that block the road we sell some of the acquired raw materials to earn funds for the purchase of seeds our basic equipment is hoe axe fishing rod and pickaxe these tools allow us to develop ourselves we fish dig minerals sometimes even get an artifact which we can return to the museum give as a present or simply sell from wood we can create all sorts of things although at the beginning there is not much choice crafting options become wider with our level the more money we have from fish fossils or other raw materials we can plant better and more expensive plants we can build chicken coop and a barn hens lay eggs and from a dug ore we make a mayonnaise machine crafting at large in the further stages of the game the pigs bring truffles we can plant grapes and when we improve our house by adding a cellar we can make wine from these grapes here everything works together the interaction of objects and skills is amazing steam shows that i played this game for hours and i still didnt earn pigs horses and wife exactly wife outside the farm there is a small town with a seed shop blacksmith who improves the ax or pickaxe fishing shop where we can buy bait and a better rod a museum where we will return artifacts and receive prizes destroyed building which we will slowly rebuild and a lot of secrets to discover but lets go back to this wife thing you can get married more than people live in the town with whom you can talk whats more we have a calendar at our disposal that will tell us when an npc has a birthday we can give them presents from among the things we found in the game not every gift has to please particular npc so with help comes wikipedia about this game but this is the only thing i check there because i do not want to spoil the fun the game is divided into seasons each season has days and each day lasts about minutes during these minutes we do what we want and at the end we sell our goods so that we could earn money the next day as you can see weve got here some rpg elements this game is huge and incredibly complex there are hundreds of things to do in exception of farming or fishing we can complete tasks for residents we can shine up to our beloved who will help us to develop our farm after wedding we make more and more better devices which are many of them the game is so huge that it incredibly draws you there is a syndrome here of one more day that we want to finish the game has no specific purpose and is actually endless once weve build all farm buildings and we have all then well want to find all the artifacts catch all the fish etc we have a mine aspect here so fans of minecraft will find themselves very well here economic aspect for fans of such species and also great music and cool oldschool graphics the price of the game is ridiculously low because we can buy it for a few dozen zlotys on steam and in electronic stores nintendo playstation store xbox we will pay over pln for the boxed version i recommend giving this game a chance because it can draw you for a long time i only miss playing online but there are some beta tests in which pc players can already participate usd pln overall rating era nintendo japanese people love nintendo and all games released by them to be financially successful this company could only be open to japan and dont care about the west until recently microsoft and sony consoles ruled in europe and the usa and in the country of blooming cherry nintendo that was the way how the market was divided and nobody was getting in each other way too much players from the west in a large minority were interested in nintendo ds or consoles while in japan there was a real craze especially about games with mario or pokmon however last year in march something has changed nintendo switch hit the market with remastered edition of zelda for the premiere good marketing the ability to play both mobile and stationary and new exclusive games have made that europeans started to buy switch consoles here on earth where the japanese company did not have anything to look for people began to play like crazy sales results have skyrocketed and nintendo became a competition for other giants sony and microsoft big n did not stop at laurels there was a brilliant mario odyssey mario kart deluxe donkey kong that i reviewed here in magazine and a treat for rpg fans xenoblade chronicles and all of this within one and a half year since the premiere no other console had such a good start nintendo also announces new pokmons and i swear blind that it will give them more players in june mario tennis aces will appear which looks incredible on the trailers great games very good marketing a community of players around the world however there is also a spoon of tar in this honey cask imagine that there is no voice chat on nintendo switch or even simply text messages to add someone to the friend list we have to provide friend code a number why cannot just type in a nickname like it everywhere does in addition we do not have a web browser youtube or applications from other websites we are still waiting for the emulation of old nintendo consoles despite technological defects the most important are games for exclusive titles lets add a multiplatform one such as fifa wolfenstein doom dark souls skyrim and now its getting very interesting nintendo has conquered the western market with its new console we are just waiting for technological improvements google vr was supposed to be a revolution indeed they are moving us to the virtual world but can we really feel like we were sitting in a real car on the example of driveclub vr i can say that we cant in a real car my head does not hurt and i do not feel any slight nausea besides after a while i felt dizzy but it was just the first impression later it was a bit easier even if google is comfortable on the head then such playing simply can tire our labyrinth can go a little crazy what is more in the driveclub i noticed small graphic clashes it is still not a perfect picture or even a very good one i would rather treat this technology more as a curiosity than fullfledged playing especially that the price of the best devices of this type is very high its best to go to a vr salon there are more and more of those in poland we will also check how our body will react to the virtual image there indeed this is a new and unbelievable device but i assume that vr developers wanted to replace traditional controllers it failed we still prefer traditional playing with pad mouse or keyboard we are not ready for vr yet although the idea is fantastic and has huge potential i will stay with the traditional technology and maybe from time to time i will visit the vr salon but i am not thinking about buying it for now the abounded in polish marketplaces full of games for cheap stationary consoles not everyone knows that those consoles were in fact a fake nes and snes consoles nevertheless they sold like fresh rolls consoles could be bought for pln and games for pln games were sold on rom cartridge usually in yellow color the sellers also had a barter trade for pln you could exchange cartridge for another one in such way fakes of original consoles were in polish homes they were even a gift on the holy communion today even though there are not so many marketplaces such consoles can be still found on online auctions although new tvs will probably stretch the picture of the game there are also emulators thanks to which we can return to golden times usd pln this is everything that i have prepared for you that was just the first time i am open for constructive criticism and new ideas as i mentioned you can write letters and your suggestions to the cultural corner on the email magazyngameeitgmailcom i think that once it was will be a constant column so its open for you boldly write about your nostalgic game memories i encourage you to do it now because before the number comes out you can forget about it as for the next magazine it will be released if this one will be read when its hard to say but i think that no more than in weeks thank you for your attention i encourage you to send emails and leave your comments down below,"{""profile"":{""about"":""Młody, niegłupi, obrotny i

,hive-115078,fagzih,2bqldk,"새로운 한국전쟁 기념벽에서 수천 개의 이름 오류, 두려움을 옹호하는 것",next month the korean war veterans memorial in the national mall will be a new focus of a memorial wall that contains the names of more than koreans who died enhancing about americans and the army who died while supporting the war their names are organized by class and each service branch showing how the burden of war fell throughout the military according to the national park administration additional and additional modifications began in early march which will take about million this groundbreaking ceremony means that the years of fundraising have been completed for many years when the congress passed the korean war veterans memorial wall citizens and companies kwvmf secretary general james fischer said in an e mail sent to the military times the korean war veterans memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the national mall where more than million visitors visit completing the wall of memory will help these visitors in honor of those who have taught the costs of war and paid the ultimate price for freedom it was the first step to get money now that you get the right name is the challenge and advocates have questioned the accuracy of the defense analysis system database used by the ministry of defense to provide the initial name list to kwvmf the walls that will include the names of those who died or missed between june and march will remind them of the cruelty of the war more than five times more than americans who died to support the korean war more than the about people who died to support war with world terrorism the month construction and rehabilitation project will be added to the korean war veterans memorial hall a new tribute to us soldiers who died of forgotten war start this week national mall nps nationalmallnps march dod will not disclose the current dcas list provided to kwvmf so the most glimpse of the data is from the public version of the list provided through the national archives and record management website the advocates of the korean war veterans are surprised by the inaccuracy they found hal and ted barker run a free online archive and a database that records missing people in korea at home near dallas this site represents more than years of research and efforts to tell the story of a korean war veteran like a father barkers and kwp volunteers told military times that there are about name inconsistency in the dcas list released through nara some should not be there some should be but not the other things are badly spelled or the format is wrong in particular the problem is that the native americans asian americans hawaiians and latin and soon this error can be cut by stone one noticeable example is the case of a naval officer who died in included in the error murder from action it remains recovered that is in march the nara public version of the dcas database edwin nixon jr navy a aircraft carrier based fighter pilot that was shot down during the korean war fell in north korea unlike his fellow pilots report nixon survived and became a prisoner of war unlike what newspapers reported and nara dcas archives he survived his trials and returned to his family in seattle and eventually had three children as a memoir for his experience killed in action dead i published wrong nixon is not the only mistake in the list another wrong item is wilson fielder jr a time magazine hong kong branch who died near daejeon in july time correspondent served as a marine corps officer during world war ii and was not active at the time of his death but did not serve at that time as a result dod recorded his death as a combat casualty other soldiers in the nara dcas list said i died in a variety of accidents said hal barker including some that do not support the operation in korea one of such examples is navy lt j ji lawrence frederick emigholz jr was killed in an accident in that he died of an accident to land a fighter in the mediterranean uss wasp his remains were not recovered according to the nara dcas database the naval pilot rover freder emmy holz jr died in an accident in the uss james c owens his spelling name is the model of the memorial wall submitted to the us art commission on september however there are other names that are not included in each name that is incorrectly included in the database missing barker explained that the air force and the naval agent who died in an accident were accidentally included some troops missing from foreign air strikes such as the first air force frank m lopez are included in the list of nara dcas he was a fighter pilot deployed in the fighterinterceptor place on the transport on october and at that time he survived the emergency landing of a damaged jet in korea and returned to his unit in japan on october i boarded the transport combat mission after the takeoff transportation disappeared over the sea due to bad weather four hours later the pilot received a radio that the fuel had fallen and the crew and passenger lopez took the remedy the aircraft did not hear the news again and the search team did not find much less debris for crew and passengers lopes remain missing and his name is displayed on the walls of memory many other troops who died on a number of flights that fell on the way to and from korea would not appear on the walls this includes soldiers who died of a crash near tachikawa air force base in june most of the troops on the plane to korea were returning to the battle mission after taking a break in japan for a while the plane crashed from the watermelon field and the only survivor died shortly after the flyer stopped and pulled him down from the rubble at that time the crash was the worst aviation accident ever and was the first plane crash that lost more than people hal barker says that the inconsistency is partially defective of the service each service has a wide variety of interpretations about the operation of the theater or has not reduced the definition of the play into writing thats a problem he said volunteers of the korean war project confirmed that the victims of the at least accidents in japan okinawa and the sea between them were missing from the official database barker said however even some of the qualifications to be included in the wall such as the borinquineers of the infantry regiment of puerto rico are suffering from spelling errors and wrong formats in the nara archive of the dcas database name of spelling or wrong form according to latin culture many soldiers usually use both maternal and maternal connections for kwvmf officials she shared with military times if two long castles are used the name or name is she pointed out the list of nara dcas on army pvt nelson galarzalebron died of wounds worn in october in his case he wrote him as nelson g lebron in the database it is according to figueroasoulet barkers said he worked to confirm and modify the puerto rico latino name problems through years of cooperation with people like puerto ricoadvocacy and figueroasoulet hal barker said the spells of three medal of honor winners are incorrectly entered into the official database many soldiers have used their pseudonym and many soldiers have changed their names by the military mistake list modification kwvmf is now working quickly to identify and solve errors in the initial dcas list the kwvmf changed its list to the ministry of defense last week and said that the department is reviewing the document last week fischer managing director of kwvmf said since february we have been diligently working on the information received from dmdc in accordance with the law by email to military times fischer explained that kwvmf was working in a potential name list but the final confirmation to be included in the wall of memory must be done by the ministry of defense we check the appropriate spells of the latin based sex and we are considering a wide range of information to reduce more than names and solve additional formatting problems because individual reporting database parameters can affect the name reported to the list according to an email shared by the documentary producer with the military times the statement that fisher spoke to the military times was changed with what other kwvmf officials told figerosulre in january kwvmfs secretarygeneral of michel au buchon said there may be an inappropriate content in latino and other names but you cant change or escape the official record of we are hr in it was a commemorative wall to commemorate the korean war veterans in january bucheon mentioned the legal requirements that the ministry of defense should provide a list of name figueroasoulet is now encouraged by kwvmfs recent modification it is right for soldiers who have served in our country but have not returned but i wonder what source is using to modify this name and the correct modification is correct santiago a spokesman for the ministry of defense said the department has established a procedure for military service departments to update or modify the error of casualties or official military files santiago said if the qualification standard is announced we will release the official list of the korean war veterans memorial hall to the public i cant disclose it publicly at this time fischer and kwvmf did not immediately respond to the questions that require a description of what kind of work they did to modify the name and what research and documentation requirements are needed we look forward to seeing the walls of memories where the exact name lists documentary producer figueroasoulet said this is the minimum thing i can do for my family,{},"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdWs1o6bSHWbH5GPcDTdb6tozdZn8krGmC51dEN8oLmo6/8091726-12614442.jpg"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNMEHEoC5tRSdExNa7NTjDjVb5bpWeC1CNZoWeGCvySML/cryptomonnaie(0).jpg"",""version"":2}}","{""tags"":[""honor"",""remember""],""users"":[""nationalmallnps""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNj2P1WictmZnN1gyP2LZ2mVcpKRa9FjFBQZM6XNAHoTW/Screenshot_20210409-223057_1.png""],""links"":[""https://t.co/8FegSDrOt2""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-09T22:17:06+00:00,52748743,
,kr,sanha88,olqkw,갈라치기 하지 마라,dont split this is the face of the so called artificial and the cabinet of the peoples republic of korea announced on september aside from the actual meaning lets just enjoy the names mr syngman rhee deputy seok yeo hyung prime minister huh heon hu home director kim gu foreign affairs kim kyu sik financial manager cho man sik military director kim won bong judicial director kim byung ro the spectrum is wide ranging from the name above from kim gu who was a certain communist and said the communist guys dont even know abbey the liberation space was so abundant among the communists and the far right nationalists shaking the flag in both extremes people with a wide variety of tendencies were living and breathing its a nationalist for a person like kim won bong how can i distinguish between heheon and kim byung ro who will have been headed many times as a human rights lawyer in colonial joseon how wide is the spacing of kim seong soo who is defined as pro japanese and nowadays however after a few years of liberation those names are torn split and gathered to the extremes of south and north as if the magnets stir in the iron powder the iron powder sticks to the n and s plays and the middle is empty in the middle those who did not choose the extremes were lonely tragedy kim gu and yeo hyung were shot cho man sik did not know life and death and kim won bong chose one side but was abandoned and sadly died who are you not to mention the directors of jang sam who left the big name in korean modern history those who were swollen left and right and north north north and liberal democracy and peoples democracy in the liberation space were wealthy and the question was usually asked in the good version of the death who are you there was a dark and painful deep night and samcheon ris gangsan was far away and on the day that the country should be ready to shine koreans became captives of the cause that each other risked their lives and immortalized the entire war to complete him for decades of the war he asked who are you on the side in the meantime there was no elaboration many of the soldiers who were killed by the left wing during the sukgun work after the yeosun incident died in the republic of korea not the people of the peoples republic if you were a red seed a child couldnt avoid bullets and sticks and a speechful ghost like proverb if you talk a lot wandered korea for decades it was a kind of compulsion we are right and they are every evil without destroying them we can never rest assured it was a spell commitment and belief that had been prisoned for decades a speech that inflated hope four years ago korea was hopeful there was a ridiculous state farming group and millions of koreans listened to the candles finally president park geun hye was dismissed due to the impeachment of the national assembly and the ruling of the constitutional court there were not many twists and turns and the people of the age of the taegeukgi were sparse but the majority of koreans swelled in hope of opening up a new era from the past which was now dull and furious i did too it was especially true when i heard this speech now i declare that the era of division and conflict should be over in korea the dichotomy of division to share the left and right on this land and to divide the progress should now be sent to the trash we must throw away the remaining confrontation conflict and division of our hearts and heads in it is true that the red lung must be liquidated the sin must be punished and those who are torn should take responsibility but red lungs faults and sins were strictly defined because of political needs it is different from my thoughts and does not fit my will so i shouldnt split and drove it into wholesale however in that regime who accepted the presidential candidate and won the election he witnessed several times that surpassed the transfer in my life my friends colleagues and seniors who were expected to meet in this demonstration had never been divided as much as this regime and they were not tough to each other it was not once or twice to seal my fear when i revealed my opinion and people with different opinions were easily stigmatized in various words giregi pro japanese x progress x scholarship creepy and transfer actors were raging and counterattacks such as moonpa daepa doors and dalrevan were naturally occurred and the question of that history and tradition who are you before he was impressed with the speech that lets send the dichotomy of division to the trash the supporters flocked to the apostle of justice and the press bulletin board was written in the article that he had eaten rice on the plate it was only an example of gueilmo that showed the giregis right in the situation where korean journalists were beaten by chinese bodyguards there is no desire to protect them just and protect their support but when the passion is expressed as an exclusive and the beliefs spread to self righteousness how dangerous the people of passion and beliefs are korean contemporary history after liberation after liberation nun showed me however the conflict which shouted to send it to the trash in the speech of the presidents own candidate has become more concerned and fiercely in the past four years and has removed the people who thought it was our side those who wrote to this government had to be stigmatized that the taste went without exception the same was true of those who contrary to the mainstream of this regime not only natural of course people who were swearing were used to swearing and the two groups were not looking at each other how much is the number of people who are so bad during the so called korean war and how many people who swept the two people who once heard like a candle the unity of those who share their own values and opinions stabbed the sky but the enemy of the enemy for those who contradicted them was isolate the government and badly we tilted together those who did not sympathize with their will only play in the farming of the giregi and the free in their lacked historical experience those who supported the so called state farming forces lee myung park geun hye were only the objects of depletion and destruction in this background there was a thorough belief that we are right we are so right that we are so right that we do not know us since today a lot of excuses will pour out it is due to the media because of the sluggish prosecution reform the of the and under the detailed plan of the pro japanese red lung forces and the people who are unexpected today that the results of this result are caused by the forgetfulness that the people have lost historical memories i will not but i shake my head well it is the result of todays results when the cry of if you are cowardly go is usually in a desperate fighting ground it is a slogan that can be given when the crowd is shaken when the possibility of winning the battle is not visible in the political version which needs to be more supported by more people and reduce the conflicts of more people how many of the governments and their supporters cry out even if they could be a majority if they believed that they could win if they had such a faithful belief is it no longer it was not in the when i fought with chun doo hwan but i dont know why i had political support and political support with this faithfulness of struggle i dont know the right thing is that the definition is proclaimed as a declaration but is completed by reflection but the belief that you are right soon chokes a reflection on your faith in addition they become absolute evils of those who believe that they threaten justice and maintain their vitality with empty hostility like the bukbol theory which will not be the scholars of the late joseon dynasty as if they were called their stomach and lined up their feet like the people who gave off the hostility of defeating one of the enemies toward the north korean communist group like the burning hostility to the us it is hoped that the number of people who burst out as the victory of pro japanese red lung forces for the results of the election will not be large i hope you are in a timely manner the more people like that the more the losers of today will be a bigger defeat so the remaining year is important

,hive-122315,zyx066,global-pissing-contest,Global Pissing Contest, the gross domestic product gdp per capita is a measure by which the relative wellbeing of the people in a country is expressed in many news articles and is used to point to a nations position on the international ladder of national economies anglofrench pissing contest source the english this is a repost of a article so some of the data used is out of date the message is unfortunately still the same though a disclaimer first obviously the gdp per capita is not the only measure of a peoples relative wellbeing or happiness theres lots of factors to consider when asking about something as subjective as happiness or wellbeing im only referring to the gdp per capita because it is one of the most used figures next to economic growth unemployment numbers debts and so on in the public narrative when talking about these issues this is not surprising in a culture thats drenched in freemarket thinking but just as misleading as the rest of it as in most instances when indicators from the market economy are used this rankingnumber for the international pissing contest between economies has no relation to real people and real lifes whatsoever please look at the ranking i just plucked from wikipedias list of countries by gdp ppp per of countries by gdp ppp per capita source you can see how finland is ranked number way below the usa thats ranked a respectable number of course this is no wonder the scandinavian countries are socialist almost communist as they are plagued and held back by heavy government interference and high taxrates no wonder they rank so low qatar is the undisputed winner in this pissing though sadly theres no beating the pissing prowess of arab princes walking on oil but seriously i hope all of you already see that being a highly trained urinator says nothing about the size of ones urinatingtool nor its ability to let its fertilizing fluids trickle down to the base of its pyramidscheme we all know it on at least a subconscious level but its good to see it confirmed in numbers the tools so often used to direct our look away from whats really important and whats really happening to that end heres the ranking list from the annual world happiness world happiness report source well well well isnt that surprising it seems scandinavians can urinate further higher and more precise than even the wealthiest arab prince or american businessgiant in this pissing contest qatar didnt even fit in there with their low ranking of number now which pissing contest is best suited to determine the finest urinators with the best equipment gdp per capita or happiness you decide i know what i believe and this is best said by robert kennedy in his presidential election campaign in february or march in the video below you can listen to the entire speech im referring to but ill give you the most important part up front even if we act to erase material poverty there is another greater task it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction purpose and dignity that afflicts us all thats a strong start already and as is the rest of his speech substitute vietnam with iraq afghanistan pakistan or any other of the many places america is at war now so very relevant in our time too much and for too long we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things our gross national product now is over billion dollars a year but that gross national product if we judge the united states of america by that that gross national product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising and ambulances to clear our highways of carnageit counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them it counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawlit counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities it counts whitmans rifle and specks knife and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our childrenyet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officialsit measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhileand it can tell us everything about america except why we are proud that we are americanssource the sadly only three months later robert f kennedy was just like john f

,politics,alexmcq,3u7u4h,美国政府再次更新黑名单,at present the biden government has indeed launched a series of gangsters in china the tension between the relationship between the two parties seems to have opened the curtain with biden new they decided to include the seven chinese supercomputers into the blacklist of the us department of commerce of course the reason for their actions was to protect national security and reasonably suspect that these companies involved military purposes the future development of these units can be said to end completely in the united states because the us government suspects that these units have secretly supporting chinas military efforts in military these companies have lost their participation in the construction of supercomputers used by the chinese military that is in various aspects they are coordinating the military modernization of chinas military modernization from the perspective of the united states this is the development of the chinese military dead so the main purpose of these companies is not world peace the us government believes that these supercomputers seem harmless but they actually have a vital role in all modern weapons including helping the development of national security levels it was seriously affected by nuclear weapons and hypersonic weapons restricted by chinese manufacturing countries the united states even watched and investigated in the secret military facilities that existed in china and there were information technology manufactured by the company among them the us software technology was used to steal the us software technology and the manufacturer was manufactured by tsmc in taiwan at present the company in the united states applied for a license to the government requiring the licenses that these companies have obtained in the us supplier and have been hung on the blacklist or any product will be strictly investigated in the future and this specification may take effect immediately and a large number of us suppliers on the way to transport although it has not responded immediately in china since the beginning of last year the united states has collaborated with european countries that have the largest companies in china including mobile phone manufacturers huawei chip manufacturer smic and the largest drone manufacturers shenzhen dji technology is included in the entity list so there is basically no chance to do international business afterwards it can be said that the united states believes that chinas rapid development in recent years cannot be separated from illegally stealing the commercial secrets of other countries and information technology and even privacy ,,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://files.steempeak.com/file/steempeak/alexmcq/T9aiobWZ-McQ-Alexander-McQueen-Logo.png"",""version"":2}}","{""tags"":[""politics""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVnoxv7tmtiUTY8Xn4bPyCozCTsMTpXWjLcbsddatALvE/D2654EBB-48F2-48AE-B3AD-D0F70922209E.webp""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-09T23:52:21+00:00,52750635,

,movies,harveyjerry640,kim-jong-un-warns-of-north-korea-crisis-similar-to-deadly-90s-famine,Kim Jong-un warns of North Korea crisis similar to deadly 90s famine,kim jongun warns of north korea crisis similar to deadly famine north korean leader kim jongun has told citizens to prepare for hard times ahead following warnings from rights groups that the country faces dire food shortages and economic instability speaking at a party conference mr kim appeared to compare the situation to the devastating famine estimated to have killed hundreds of thousands north korea has shut its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic trade with china its economic lifeline has come to a standstill this is on top of existing international economic sanctions over pyongyangs nuclear programme imagine a north korean family north koreas sidelined human rights crisis the south koreans enslaved in the norths mines what did kim say in a rare admission of looming hardship the authoritarian leader of the singleparty state on thursday called on officials to wage another more difficult arduous march in order to relieve our people of the difficulty even a little the arduous march is a term used by north korea officials to refer to the countrys struggle during the famine when the fall of the soviet union left north korea without crucial aid the total number of north koreans who starved to death is not known but estimates range up to million it is not unusual for kim jongun to talk about difficulties and hardship but this time the language is quite stark and thats different colin zwirko north korea analyst at nk news told the bbc last october for instance he gave a speech where he said that he himself failed to bring about enough changes but mentioning explicitly that hes decided to carry out a new arduous march is not something he has said before earlier this week mr kim had warned the country faced the worstever situation and unprecedentedly numerous challenges how bad is the situation there have been warnings for months that the people of north korea are struggling reports of hardship appear to be coming especially from towns near the chinese border where smuggling would have been a huge earner for many the price of corn the staple diet for most of rural north korea has reportedly fluctuated enormously and at times a kilogram of corn has cost more than a months wages lina yoon a researcher from human rights watch hrw said in a recent report citing unnamed contacts in the country that there is barely any food going into the country from china there are so many more beggars some people died from hunger in the border area and theres no soap toothpaste or batteries she wrote whats it like to live in north korea russians leave north korea on handpushed trolley the un special rapporteur on north korean human rights toms ojea quintana warned last month in a report of a serious food crisis already leading to malnourishment and starvation deaths by starvation have been reported as has an increase in the number of children and elderly people who have resorted to begging as families are unable to support them it is unclear whether any aid at all is currently coming into the country north korea has rejected offers of external aid and almost all diplomats and aid workers including staff of the uns world food programme wfp have left meanwhile north koreas border closures means trade with china dropped by last year from levels that had already fallen significantly in when the un expanded sanctions over north koreas nuclear programme reports suggest north korea restricted imports of staple foods from china last august and then cut almost all trade including food and medicines in october the country has also ramped up punishments for smuggling describing it as antisocialist and enemy behaviour according to hrw north korea was also hit by two major storms last summer which caused flooding that is believed to have damaged crops exacerbating the shortages presentational grey line analysis box by laura bicker seoul correspondent kim jongun is shoring up support within his party as times get tough hes making sure that the warnings are coming from him perhaps so that when things get worse he can point the finger at his officials for not acting on his orders he can also pin blame for the dire economy on the pandemic and the strict economic sanctions designed to curb his nuclear weapons programme and yet his regime continues to design and test new missiles the weapons tests are something we can all see on satellite images and state media photos and use them to question world leaders about how they are going to act the north korean people cannot get images of their suffering to us without the risk of being imprisoned or shot unseen and according to warnings by their own leader they now face going hungry amid a looming humanitarian crisis,{},,"{""tags"":[""movies""],""links"":[""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2674/Home/Kinox_1080P__Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_Ganzerfilm_2021Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_Schweiz_Stream_Film"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2332/Home/Voller_Film_in_Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_online_anschauen_Ganzerfilm_2021_Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_Kostenlos"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2333/Home/Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_2021_Herunterladen_Kostenfreier_Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_Ganzer_Film_Deutsch"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2676/Home/Ganzerfilm_deutsch_HD_Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_Deutsch_Stream_Kostenlos_2021_Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_BulletSchweiz_Film"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2678/Home/Ganzer_Film_Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_2021_deutsch_Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_HD_ONLINE"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2683/Home/FuLL__WATCH24Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_2021Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_Complete_HD"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2334/Home/GOOGLE_DRIVE__Mp4_Detective_Conan_The_Scarlet_Bullet_2021_FullMovie24GOOGLE_DOCs_Meitantei_Conan_Hiiro_no_dangan_ENGSUB"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2425/Home/__"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2688/Home/_"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2689/Home/HD720p__Mortal_Kombat_2021"",""https://ott.instructure.com/eportfolios/578/Home/__"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2695/Home/_Mortal_Kombat_2021____HDTHAI"",""https://ott.instructure.com/eportfolios/585/Home/"",""https://ott.instructure.com/eportfolios/586/Home/Phim_Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_2021_Full_HDVietSubThuyt_Minh"",""https://owasso.instructure.com/eportfolios/538/Home/Xem_y__Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_HD_2021_trc_tuyn_y__phim_HD_1080p_min_ph"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2708/Home/Xem_y__Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_HD_2021_trc_tuyn_y__phim_HD_1080p_min_ph"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2467/Home/123_Phim_trc_tuyn__2021_Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2716/Home/Xem_phim_Online_2021_Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_Full_HD720Px_min_ph"",""https://ssd.instructure.com/eportfolios/2471/Home/Xem_phim_Online_2021_Mortal_Kombat_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_Full_HD_min_ph_Google_Drive"",""https://jfox.instructure.com/eportfolios/2730/Home/Mortal_Kombat2021_Cuc_chin_sinh_t_phin_bn_c_bit_tt_c_ph__trc_tuyn""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-10T04:29:00+00:00,52756124,

scene the september incident zhang xueliangs immature choice has led to the loss of millions of kilometers directly and his reputation has also plummeted and even regarded as a public enemy of the nation in xian incident zhang xueliangs feat has contributed to the anti japanese united front and wins the respect of the world sadly he lost his freedom himself zhang xueliang was buried by himself with his own dignity after zhang xueliang fell into his life how did he live without freedom zhang xueliang felt that other material life should not be too bad zhang xueliang was not bitter in his imprisonment career and miss zhao si brushed his teeth for yuan a month zhang xueliang also wrote a letter crying to song ziwen lending hundreds of thousands of money zhang xueliang extraction of freedom zhang xueliang had a brilliant career and was imprisoned by the kuomintang for the xian incident time has passed fast and it will take years in a flash was just a year of victory in the anti japanese war although zhang xueliang has been restricted to life freedom he has always maintained the habit of reading newspapers and magazines and always paid attention to current affairs news zhang xueliang knew the good news of this day and had new hope in his heart should he be over the end of his imprisonment because of the anti japanese war zhang xueliangs inner waves are ups and downs zhang xueliang knew that the original soldiers seemed to be very strong but it made chiang kai shek very annoyed chiang kai shek is another person who knows revenge and is likely to not release him easily at present the situation in china has changed and there may be front line turns but the complexity of the northeast zhang xueliang is very clear many bombs are still buried there it is over the end of the war of resistance against japan and northeast china is doing things from this perspective chiang kai shek will not release him the the anti japanese war is a victory the momentum of the communist party is like a rainbow but chiang kai shek will not easily abandon his government the kuomintang and the communist party are essential but it is hard to say what kind of struggle will chiang kai shek do even if he is struggling to dying how chiang kai shek will deal with his dead enemy not to mention that zhang xueliang is a thorn in chiang kai sheks mind zhang xueliangs power and influence are not to be ignored by chiang kai shek it is a good example to reach the anti japanese united front if zhang xueliang is released chiang kai shek will only have a sense of insecurity to return to the mountains zhang xueliang thought that it was not easy to talk to chiang kai shek about release but it is not a thing to continue being imprisoned it is better to find a way to find the way after all the days of being imprisoned were not good and only zhang xueliang knew it this is related to zhang xueliangs life contrast zhang xueliang has been in a state of rising stages in his life he has become the head of the northeast military and politics before he stands and he is the youngest dictator in the world zhang xueliang has long been used to a good life of flowers and he is naturally unable to get used to the bitter day of imprisonment it seems that miss zhao si accompanied by monitoring their special agents everywhere and made this love taste zhang xueliang used to be a handsome man who came to open his mouth and his clothes to reach out after imprisonment this day was gone zhang xueliang used to deal with the major events of fighting the quartet every day but now he has nothing to do how can you not be willing to do it chiang kai shek would not let him leave one side lived and his relative freedom was already the greatest tolerance for chiang kai shek zhang xueliang was beaten and accepted and there was no other law it wasnt for him to escape but the troops of hundreds of people looked at him which made him be monitoring it can be said that zhang xueliangs life is always under supervision and cannot get real freedom whether or not the victory of the anti japanese war how the civil war in the kmt and the communist party of china has no gayness with this detained in the past what he can do is only in the imprisonment of chiang kai shek freedom in the lifetime of chiang kai shek it must be impossible death as long as he is still there he cannot reach naturally chiang kai sheks discussion is naturally influenced by his young handsome in the northeast the so called rabbit dead dog cooks zhang xueliang is alive and the interests of chiang kai shek are the biggest it is not completely chilling to be the heart of zhang zuolins old part this truth chiang kai shek naturally understands zhang xueliang was banned for years how did zhang xueliang spend peaceful days in the long ban and finally enjoyed his old age i have to say that zhang xueliang is good to himself and he never thought of treating himself borrow money armed daily life zhang xueliang see through chiang kai sheks heart and continues to peace of mind to live a life restricted to life since the life is going to pass it will be more quality zhang xueliang raised his pen and asked song ziwen for help by writing in the letter zhang xueliang also let go of the original ao jiao and mentioned it without any concealment that he lived with a stretched life zhang xueliang opened the door and wrote that the cash brought from hong kong has long been used up i wanted to ask dai yan to support it but i also knew that dai yan had difficulty and didnt want to trouble him often therefore he could only speak to you zhang xueliang also attributed the embarrassment of his life to inflation he wrote in the letter that life is not good mainly because the current price has risen too fast i didnt settle the account in person this account was really scared simply calculate the necessary expenses of life and the four sisters and i have to smoke a month we are still very restrained the number of smoking is controlled at about just use cigarette cigarettes to satisfy the addiction in addition we just accidentally add new clothes plus the two maids and the expenses of buying magazines and books the cost of brushing the teeth is yuan per month zhang xueliang couldnt help but sigh in the letter todays money is too worthless now yuan is not worth hundreds of dollars before the war the numbers are too big zhang xueliang called bitterly i have not been poor but now i have tasted the poor taste i ca nt change the poverty but i still have to continue to live i m not afraid of your jokes i can only ask you for help now i thought in my heart either borrowing hundreds of thousands of dignity from the bank or you after reading the letter song ziwen immediately wrote back to zhang xueliang and immediately grasped the implementation one by one to meet all the requests of zhang xueliang song ziwen also surprised zhang xueliang unexpectedly and took a lot of high end goods to zhang xueliang outsiders may be difficult to understand song ziwen will meet zhang xueliangs seemingly unreasonable request in the eyes of ordinary people zhang xueliangs monthly brushing expenditure of yuan is an astronomical figure but compared with zhang xueliangs past day this is really nothing song ziwen prisoner is not prisoned in the xian incident the people who angrily anger chiang kai shek had yang hucheng besides zhang xueliang after chiang kai shek escaped from the dilemma he also asked yang hucheng to calculate the account after autumn yang hucheng was busy having a child while being imprisoned by chiang kai shek chiang kai shek could not see his regret and his dissatisfaction with yang hucheng increased day by day yang hucheng died under the knife of the unknown stroke zhang xueliang also plays a fate of house arrest in the end he can survive longevity and has a great relationship with zhang xueliangs yearning for a good life he hopes to return to the day of dignity during the ban on zhang xueliang the freedom of physical activity was restricted by the cage but the fire of his inner hope was always burning zhang xueliang has not desperate for life he never forgets to read read newspapers and learn zhang xueliang also realized a tao for the future he wanted he had to let go of his body first zhang xueliang is a proud person this puts must not destroy his bottom line and he cannot be fascinated by himself using the opportunity to learn from reading zhang xueliang softened to chiang kai shek in a way of reading and cleverly admitted his mistakes to chiang kai shek in this euphemistic way and also brought chiang kai shek to daigao hat essence good night zhang xueliang if you meet someone else zhang xueliang should have been released early but it is unfortunately the opponent is chiang kai shek his small belly chicken intestines are famous once he formed liang zi with him he will not be able to solve it in this life however zhang xueliangs efforts were not a little effect chiang kai shek just placed him under house arrest and did not kill him zhang xueliangs imprisonment years material life may not be too bad at least chiang kai sheks specification is not low and the assistance of friends in the past zhang xueliangs spiritual life is not empty there are beautiful women and books nourish their body and mind but zhang xueliang is a pursuit perhaps zhang xueliang was willing to suffer on the battlefield and he did not want to be a avoidance of the world in troubled times zhang xueliangs emotions in his later years expressed the depression in his heart to the fullest zhang xueliang once said that my life has come to an end at the age of and so far there is no chapter in life in a strict sense we can be regarded as my life at the age of to zhang xueliang as a one hundred year old longevity his definition of his satisfaction in his life is only years during the ban zhang xueliang also felt that he became a delicate waste but he still lived seriously maybe zhang xueliangs support for self discarding himself may be his dreams he has always dreamed that he returned to freedom and returned to the young handsome he loved and contributed his strength to the country and national cause again life cant avoid the wind and waves and has a mentality of insulting and strolling in the court in order to get out of the storm its a kind of extravagance in life but the mentality is quiet and it is in the hands of everyone may everyone find the best self in the extraordinary years

,bitcoin,asitrading,china-s-lethal-weapon,China's lethal weapon, the financial times magazine surprised its readers by declaring that the chinese economy will be ranked first in the world starting from the end of this year if it is believed that this event will not be before the year the weakness of the yuan may be behind the acceleration of this occurrence it is well known in the economy that countries tend to weaken their currencies especially in recessionary economic cycles in order to stimulate external demand by exporting to other countries in china with the tremendous growth that this economic power is experiencing the exchange rate of the yuan should have been higher than it is in terms of the currency reflecting the national wealth here lies the secret of the chinese economic policy which secured global markets through a weak yuan how have governments managed to keep the yuans exchange rate low china is the second largest economy in the world in terms of the size of the economy with a gross domestic product of billion dollars behind the united states of america billion dollars this economic capacity was acquired by china as a result of the socioeconomic model it adopted in the seventies of the last century which contains continuous interference by the government with a liberal whiff in the economy this model allowed the chinese economy to grow by since the eighties of the last century and until the emergence of the global financial crisis in what is striking about this is the lack of vulnerability of this model to global financial and economic shocks in the short term in the period extending over the first ten years of the current century chinas participation in the growth of the global economy amounted to the equivalent of a third absolute value in parallel with the great poverty of the chinese people and the confinement of wealth to a limited class of businessmen who live in large cities shanghai hong kong and macau this poverty is characterized by a gdp of approximately per capita a small number relative to the size of the chinese economy the structure of the chinese economy is divided into agriculture with of the gdp industry with and the rest to the service sector agriculture occupies the first place in terms of manpower with of the total workforce as for the industry that produces half of the gdp it employs the equivalent of of the total labor force this indicates the extent of chinas high production efficiency but what is striking in the chinese economy is the surplus in the trade balance which brings into the treasury huge funds that allowed china to have a high margin of movement on the financial level with currency reserves exceeding billion at the beginning of this year this has led to the expansion of unconventional and unregulated finance shadow banking which is currently estimated at billion if the public sector still dominates the economy the growth of the private sector has a fundamental role in chinese growth and pushing the chinese economy to massively integrate into the global economy monetary policy in the service of the economy china has adopted a fierce monetary policy based on the weakening of the yuan in order to ensure that production is discharged abroad the interest in the external market comes from the premise that the huge internal market billion people contains a high percentage of poverty even if the percentage of the population living below the poverty line is the large part of the chinese people is not far from this line nor his financial capabilities allow him to buy internal production which means that internal demand is weak relative to external demand the chinese monetary policy is divided into several axes all of which aim to weaken the yuan the policy of the chinese central bank which is based on printing the yuan in a large scale justified by the huge population the interest rates imposed by the chinese central bank and which chinese banks are absolutely obligated to currently buying large american treasury bonds billion dollars which means an organic link between the us dollar and its chinese counterpart in other words every weakness in the us dollar is reflected in the yuan as a result of the huge portfolio of us assets carried by china this is unconventional and japan tried to do it but it did not succeed as well as china because of the lack of cash that it has this monetary policy has been subjected to a lot of criticism from economically developed countries and those in the process of growth and most of the time led to a currency war but china has proven its enormous ability in this game supported by the financial surplus that it used as a lethal weapon against the united states america in the first place and against european countries and japan in the second degree qualitative economic shift china is expected to witness high growth rates as a result of the development of internal demand which is currently in a deep dormant state of the state of poverty in which the chinese people live but that billion people consume in the western manner which means that the chinese production machine will not be able to meet their needs with this in mind many international companies have opened branches in china taking advantage of the low structural cost of production in the hope that the yellow genie will one day wake up under pressure from the international monetary fund china set out to start building electrical plants in the whole country this comes from the premise that electricity is an essential element in social development which will push many chinese to join the labor market and thus increase their consumption capacity china has drawn up a strategic plan based on building more than nuclear plants for the production of electricity in addition to the many existing ones that have reoperated using coal that china has in abundance and in lebanon it is clear that the absence of any economic plan for the advancement of the lebanese economy is a flaw when we see the chinese plans that are trying to ensure the continuity and sustainability of the growth of the economy hence we encourage the lebanese government to follow the socioeconomic model that gives the state a basic role in economic policies and at the same time leaves room for the liberal spirit that will form the basis of economic growth,{},"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdXLg4iRfoAiiTJf42ELm6o8uQKeTeAiaJeZv6CFj9dyd/i-register_woman.jpg"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmbM3ZxFYVjr8CyueAnotuaPjy21qRed1GSKrfiUbkPUyZ/news_article_image_crypto_investor_in_singapore_is_buyer_of_69_million_beeple_nft_image.jpg"",""version"":2}}","{""tags"":[""bitcoin"",""news"",""chaina"",""crypto"",""economy""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmegT2VvFH9NyWXsmksJHT9vJ5h3kAo8e3PPkeX4Uuk34V/Screenshot_20210410-080632_Google.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-10T07:13:03+00:00,52759368,
,hive-193186,wudaige,3ja29n,为何美国宁愿选择战败，也不在朝鲜战场上使用原子弹？, at the end of world war ii with the tenacious resistance of other alliances and our country many aggressive countries announced their surrender but under the overall situation japan has not agreed to announce the surrender in order to get better defeat so in order to accelerate the surrender of japan the united states launched two atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki respectively of course it also had its own selfishness two atomic bombs continued japan soon announced the surrender after surrender it was only a wolf state and dead silence left to japan for the first time people also saw the terrible power of the atomic bomb but it was puzzled that when the united states confronted north korea at that time he would rather choose to defeat or not use the atomic bomb in fact it is not that the united states does not want it they dare not dare the outbreak of the korean war from the end of world war i to world war ii the united states has become a world power due to the baptism of the war and it can fight against the soviet union because of its nuclear weapons anti impartiality only means that the strength of the two parties is equivalent but the united states has always been dissatisfied and has always wanted to branches independently to become the worlds first power the cuban missile crisis has become the opportunity and the nuclear weapons in the hands of both sides almost launched involving humans into a state of no longer the korean war has nothing to do with the united states and the soviet union because his essence is the internal war of the korean peninsula due to the two independent regimes split on the peninsula they want to achieve unity through the method of armed suppression which led to the outbreak of the war the soviet union and the united states did not want to take the initiative on the bright side of the asian region they just restricted and suppressed it the same is true of the korean peninsula but in january a negotiation between the soviet union and my country changed the status quo after the negotiations the soviet union was suffering a huge pressure from our country he knew that china could no longer let him call him so he was ready to change his goal in the end he chose the korean peninsula on the civil war and he the resources that quickly stopped in the port of lushun port in my country were transferred to a port on the korean peninsula later the united states seemed to see the soviet union so much thinking that he wanted to expand the korean peninsula as the foundation of his own foothold in asia so he began to attack north korea and north korea while the civil war has the american invasion naturally cant resist so he calls for help from my country in the end my country led troops to support north korea which promoted the later war against the united states and aid north korea why did the united states be defeated or not used nuclear weapons after the joint army of the us forces joined the battle the war began to fall to the ground naturally north korea could not resist the advanced us military but after the volunteer army of our country joined the battle changed i have never thought that the advanced us military will actually be equipped with the chinese army that is much different from them to the south of the line the war time in north korea is three years during these three years the us military has invested a lot of force but it has not achieved any results in this case why the united states no longer throw a atomic bomb and explodes what about north korea first the opposition from the allies for the defeat of the us military on the korean peninsula macarthur then the commander in chief of the time tried to respect the use of atomic bombs and used the atomic bomb for the boundary between my country and north korea in this way a radiation zone can be effectively formed on the boundary line then my countrys supply cannot be transported to north korea by that time without the help of our volunteer army the us military will be fearless the president truman was very tempted at the time of macarthurs suggestion after all this was indeed a method that could solve the problem from the root cause but before truman said many allies in the united states protested some people say that the american launching atomic bomb hit north korea what does it have to do with you in fact it really has a lot to do who makes them the allies in the united states if the united states fires atomic bombs then we must largely be unable to fight the us military and the us military will occupy north korea the soviet union who has always wanted to use north korea as its own asia is unwilling and they will also give an atomic bomb in the united states but too far they may not reach the united states so they will find the american allies and they are closer to the soviet union at the time therefore nearly a hundred british members of the uk stood up at the time expressing opposition to the united states use of atomic bombs in this battle and even churchill the former prime minister was among the opponents teams in the end truman couldnt resist the opposition of many allies so he reluctantly agreed to use atomic bombs on the korean peninsula the nuclear bomb is limited and it is not necessarily a winning although the united states has nuclear countries and the two consecutive generations of presidents are very much in favor of the development and use of nuclear weapons but the cost of nuclear weapons is very expensive even if it was the united states the atomic bomb that had been at that time was very limited if the atomic bomb could not reverse the situation it would become unnecessary to use the atomic bomb because the three or eight lines are divided into south korea and north korea there are many mountains in north korea even if the united states drops the atomic bomb it may not cause much casualties secondly even if it is a densely troops at the junction of the line there are air proof holes and tunnels built in my country even atomic bombs may not be completely destroyed this is not an exaggeration at that time there was a study in the united states that as long as the tunnel and the air proof hole reached a certain depth even if they were in the center of the atomic bomb explosion they could not be abandoned and retreated a jealousy from the soviet union as a soviet union which has a nuclear weapon like the united states the united states is very concerned about it at any time as is the korean war however during the korean war the soviet union did not send troops on the bright side to help us but to help volunteers with weapons support in the back because of the signing of the china soviet friendly treaty as long as one party is attacked the other party will be obliged to send troops to help if the united states uses atomic bombs against our army then the soviet union will just join the battle and the soviet union may also take this opportunity to fire atomic bullets to the united states at that time the two major powers broke out of the nuclear war the united states will become the target of the criticism it will be condemned by the country stupid behavior fourth the national anti war is high unable to use if the united states insists on the use of atomic bombs the battle of the korean war will continue to expand and expansion means that more american soldiers need to go to the battlefield due to the end of world war ii the people enjoyed a long lost peace and no longer wanted war but if the united states uses atomic bombs all this will become a bubble so many people in china have opposed opinions on the decision of the united states who want to use atomic bombs and hope that the united states can end the war as soon as possible

,hive-120412,tambi,mission-impossible-fallout-spy-action-cinema,"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" : Spy Action Cinema",mission impossible fallout continues the story of the confrontation between the mission impossible squad and the syndicate terrorist group which consists of former intelligence agents from around the world although the head of the syndicate solomon lane was neutralized by ethan hunt in mission impossible rogue nation his remaining colleagues could bring a lot of trouble it becomes known that they are trying to extract three plutonium charges and assemble portable nuclear bombs on their basis only ethan hunt can prevent the renegades as usual tom cruise probably made a deal with the devil after all how else to explain the fact that from mission to mission he is only getting younger he performs complex tricks himself runs like crazy breaks his legs learns to fly in helicopters how much energy is there in this person perhaps mission impossible fallout is worth watching at least as a motivator maybe at least it will make you exercise in the morning continuing the trend set in the last film in mission impossible fallout tom cruise performs most of the stunts on his own and sometimes they are really difficult stunts if in rogue nation he a big fan of motorcycles underwent special training on stunt driving then during the preparation for the filming of fallout the actor learned how to fly a helicopter seriously cruz himself does some of the helicopter stunts in the epic final chase and its just incredible and by the way it gives an amazing sense of realism which cannot be achieved in films with a green screen in what is happening in mission impossible despite all the madness of some episodes you really believe just compare footage from fallout to recent skyscraper almost entirely filmed with a chroma key it really is heaven and earth reflections glare small details another bonus of real tricks in fallout is the absolutely indescribable expression on tom cruises face when he gets into an accident jumps from an airplane it took about a hundred real long jumps from a height of over m to shoot one landing or crashes his chest into the edge of a building at full speed this perhaps and you will not play by the way tom still broke his leg during filming which led to a sevenweek delay and cost the studio a pretty penny fortunately the insurance covered the costs in general action in fallout is not just a lot but a lot so much so that part of it just didnt make it into the final cut of the film some of the episodes we saw in the trailers will only appear as bonuses on bluray and this is probably for the better even in an abbreviated form the picture stretched out for a good two and a half hours however flew by almost imperceptibly the mission impossible squad team was formed in the previous film it is a pity that jeremy renners hero dropped out of it but we guessed it with the participation of rebecca ferguson in the new film in general by the number of beautiful women in one tape ethan hunt easily plugs bond james bond into the belt in addition to the deadly ilsa faust played by rebecca ferguson the gallant operative is surrounded by michelle monaghan who returned to the role of julia hunt and vanessa kirby the crown everest who plays the fatal white widow everything is great in the new picture and with the locations mission impossible fallout can be used as a guide to both paris the french media just love it and london during a car chase in paris ethan hunt and his pursuers go around it seems all the famous sights of the french capital and during a walking chase in london you can virtually climb the dome of st pauls cathedral and enjoy an unusual view from the rooftops of the city and southerk districts by the way the final fight of the film was not filmed in kashmir at all the stone tongue on which the helicopters of the heroes fall is located in norway this is the famous giant preikestolen cliff above the lysefjord which was closed to tourists for nine whole days whats more impressive about mission impossible fallout is the sound design and soundtrack it is highly recommended to watch this film in a cinema with the highest quality acoustics imax and are of course cool and will not be superfluous here but the sound is much more important before writing this review i was completely sure that hans zimmer wrote the fallout soundtrack imagine my surprise when it turned out that lorne balfe the author of compositions for crysis call of duty modern warfare beyond two souls assassins creed games as well as ghost in the shell films was responsible for the music in the film sherlock holmes and sherlock holmes a game of shadows and the crown and genius tv series on many of the films games mentioned zimmer and balfe have worked together so its no surprise that their styles have become somewhat similar in any case lorne balfes work for mission impossible fallout is really impressive and i would be surprised if the composer does not collect a decent harvest of awards by the end of the year mission impossible fallout is an excellent film in every respect entertaining holistic dynamic against the background of the latest rather weak tapes about bond the same specter and the stumped jason bourne series mission impossible seems to be becoming the main spy action series of the we hope that tom cruise will have enough strength and enthusiasm for at least one more trilogy

,ama,sancti,seascape-ama-recap-with-crypto-royals,SEASCAPE AMA RECAP WITH CRYPTO ROYALS, on the of april the founder of seascape david and the cmo of seascape kerel had the opportunity to embark on an eventful ama session with crypto royals seascape founder david and cmo joined the crypto royals telegram channel to provide the community with insight on what seascape is all about the roadmaps information on how to achieve the roadmap and plans and events the ama session was moderated by makul sharma crypto royals community moderator to ensure clarity this article is divided into three sections the first section gives a full account of questions asked by the ama host while the second section gives full detail of questions asked by the twitter community and the third section captures the detailed questions asked by the telegram community section aryan soni good evening everyone i am pleased to have the seascape network team join our ama today kerel hello guys nice to meet you all im kerel the cmo of seascape david hey happy to be here ready to talk about the future of defi gaming makul sharma could you please introduce yourselves to the community and tell us about your background david hey everyone im david founder and creative director of the seascape network ive been a game developer for the last decade working in studios such as paradox interactive mainly working on historical strategy games i started getting involved in blockchain in first as an investor and later as the creator of blocklords which was the first blockchain strategy game since then weve received funding and grants from many major blockchain institutions and protocols and we are ready to take the next step on our journey by developing the seascape network a game platform designed around the defi and nft economies kerel hey guys im kerel the cmo of seascape ive been working in marketing for my whole career mostly in gaming and crypto ive worked in many companies over the years and was always super excited about defi and nft in particular i joined seascape after david told me about it as the project seemed so revolutionary nice to meet you all makul sharma please tell the community about seascape in detail david seascape network is a game platform designed around the defi and nft economies s me and my team were working on blocklords which is a very ambitious blockchain strategy game we started noticing a lot of problem with most blockchain protocols and the sdks they provided to game developers which made the development of successful and scalable dapps almost impossible for small teams as we improved our project management processes and workflow as well as with our increased experience in smart contracts we decided we could develop a platform ourselves and offer the tools to other game devs to access the world of blockchain this along with our excitement about defi and the added liquidity it provides to small projects made us take the leap and go from developing one game to a whole platform instead twitter questions ques seascape is a cryptographic game platform based on the game but how much value do you think it gives to your project to be built on the chain of blocks and more specifically on the crosschain and not based on the traditional methods known until today kerel each chain has specific projects and advantages that together make an entirely unique ecosystem using a single chain would limit what we could do on our platform and crosschain functions would allow us to not only provide value to more people but also have access to more unique features for example we announced a partnership with moonbeam a couple of weeks ago that got us excited and we want to provide each chain that has enough users projects and liquidity with the unique tools that the seascape platform will bring for blockchain game development ques what accomplishments would you like to achieve for the nft world was seascape created to make that dream come true and how you can encourage this project to stay on the path of your dreams david the main issue with nfts right now is that they are mainly speculative collectables but we think they have much more potential especially when you start seeing nfts as potential financial assets within different games this is something we are working on solving with our series of defi and nft games profit circus nft brawl and staking saloon nfts that are minted in circus and brawl can be staked for cws or seascape network utility token in our upcoming game staking saloon staking saloon will offer great rewards to all who stake nfts especially if they stake powerful combos but the crux is that when you claim the rewards your nfts will be destroyed meaning if you want to stake again and repeat the loop you have to get back out there and hunt for more nfts this is how we plan to advance the field of nfts by fusing it with defi ques in march seascape network announced plans for an outofthisworld partnership with moonbeam how through these new strategic partnerships will seascape be able to build several defi games on eth and bsc how will moonbean contribute to this seascape purpose kerel moonbeam allows us to enter the polkadot one of the most interesting projects out there polkadot would allow for much better scaling and provide a great for a great cheap option for us to launch our game and ensure that it would be a bridge with eth also one of the unique things we will do with moonbeam is an exclusive game with moonbeam we can be one of the first defi projects to be deployed on polkadot ques you said that crowns token will be the way for most players to experience the power of defi games in a fun easy to use way can you explain to us in detail what their function is within seascape why you say it is so important david crowns are the official token of the seascape network weve written a number of articles discussing these in detail but succinctly buy games and services on the scape store stake in seascape defi to earn competitive yields mint and trade seascape standard nft create pcc playercreated coins backed by crowns validate the seascape network and secured the seascape chain tradein exchanges and profit your time spending in seascape you can check this article for more details ques the seascape ecosystem aims to be a home for game developers and users how will you make this possible in addition to entertainment what other benefits will seascape offer through its games what kinds of benefits will these new players attract kerel over our years of developing a blockchain game we noticed that one of the major pains is the lack of uniform tools for devs so one of the biggest thing we will do is to give out welldocumented sdks for devs to develop their game on our platform so one of the biggest thing we will do is to give out welldocumented sdks for devs to develop their game on our platform we aim to bring about a much easier and faster onboarding of devs to the world of blockchain gaming seascape is also not just about entertainment but about incentivizing both developers and players through the games players could earn rewards from playing the games earning the coins and the nfts a good example is our first three games profit circus nft brawl and staking saloon in profit circus you can stake your crowns lp to earn more crowns in nft brawl you can spend your crowns to mint nfts that you can then stake on staking saloon to earn crowns back its a whole ecosystem built around reward users for actually playing the games play to earn instead of the traditional pay to win telegram community questions ques apparently many blockchain projects are not solving any real problem they just exist to sell their tokens what problems exactly is your platform solving and what solutions are you provide david we are making it much easier for game developers to release new and innovative blockchain games with our upcoming set of game development tools this is how we plan to bring mass adoption to the blockchain through gaming once users realize that they can earn real profits from their time spent playing there will be no way to put that genie back in the box ques many projects rug pulled an exit scam recently why should investors trust your project not to do the same david well first off weve been active in the blockchain space for the last years our investors are some of the tops in the field including binance ld capital and many more reputable institutions we have over dollars locked in liquidity on eth and bsc and most importantly we are clear and transparent with the community and continue releasing great defi games for our fans have over dollars locked in liquidity on eth and bsc and most importantly we are clear and transparent with the community and continue releasing great defi games for our fans ques ive seen you have done meme competitions to grow your community and be more engaging with them in a funny way can you tell us what other plans do you have to make your community grow kerel we are planning to have several related competitions with stickers gifs videos comments and others on a different number of media to engage our community but will also host events team battles and finally increase interactions with our games to keep the community in a fun and engaging way secondly we are also opening many more new local communities we have recently opened in japan korea vietnam and are planning to open in turkey spanish indonesian and russia ques a partnership is essential for adoption so can you tell us what partners you have now and in the future david so far weve partnered with chainlink binance moonbeam pancakeswap bakeryswap dego opensea and many more we have new partnerships every week so be sure to follow our groups to stay updated ques what are your top things for priorities in could you share some plans for the upcoming year or any secret kerel finishing up releasing the series of minigames we are developing opening up our tools to other game devs to bring them to blockchain gaming and taking it to the next level fully decentralizing the seascape platform to become the top blockchain game makul added by thanking everyone for joining us for todays session with seascape network and special thanks to david and kerel for such an informative

world is wider and more beautifuleven more beautiful than ours i found these barnacles on the coast or you could say these barnacles are in the ocean including in the sea of aceh i took it because i was impressed by its shape and uniqueness compared to the shells that i met earlier which is very unique and attractive to me beautiful colors and brownish stripes and a shape that is somewhat like a coral reef and also has many holes the world of the oceans also includes a world full of wonders and many uniqueness that we have never seen far beyond even the human world i thought and this is the picture i got today i hope you all like it ocean life teritipbarnaclesfotografer partnermacro the ocean is an exciting tourist object the ocean is often used as one of the fun tourist objects and announces especially if we hear about marine tourism it must be very tempting for us to enjoy with the blue sky and sea water that meet and seem to merge at one corner on the stretch of waves and also

,hive-189569,nevachaze,weekend-in-migeya,Weekend in Migeya,before returning to writing a diary i decided to write antorv for advice how to write posts correctly and correctly cool z saturdaymemories bulf of the same prosei so yak sobota that bi ni the only thing allow myself a small intro due to a long absence in steemit hoping for your understanding internally in thoughts since childhood i always wanted to supplement the reality with something special you are walking on a wild beach in berdyansk on a warm summer evening and in my head i am now in la on the shore of the pacific ocean and the yacht is about to come to the island where a quest party with local shamans is taking place or walking in the park pushkin in the center of donetsk with coffee in a paper cup you involuntarily draw aristocratic manners for yourself and run away with thoughts into the world where you are a major player of the world economy and wait for a meeting with a person from the government in order to refuse again before officials absolutely d thatking adequate perception plureality or just a childish prank so i thought to myself years but i did not stop fantasize turn out to be the opportunity and he revealed the cinematic perception the creative part of himself which i know to this day with age replacing reality has almost disappeared i learned to notice what is happening admire the world and appreciate the surrounding life attention moved to people nature details instead of supplementing reality it appeared to capture convey the elusive essence of the beauty of the surrounding i cant imagine my life without video shooting this is a miracle that inspires not only to save the memory but to share your vision listening way of thinking its history part of your life and finally in saturdaymemories a great occasion to load into memories breathe life into an dusty story with the bowels of consciousness and remember who you are and where you are as well as share the story with caring readers migiy a village in the pervomaisky district of the nikolaev region of ukraine so wikipedia will say about this but personally i have the warmest memories with this place and there are three significant reasons for that reason no the trip became an oasis soul bodily psychological a halo of freedom in may in the midst of quarantine when nothing except the internet worked and the people only learned to carry out charging in the morning at zoom to maintain a working spirit with colleagues when you have been sitting in the apartment for two months and only daily run in the morning and sorties to the supermarket serve as an outlet oh yeah this trip became a memorable oasis i am jerking secondly a trip to this beautiful place this is our first with a beloved joint adventure we decided to meet in neutral territory she came from nikolaev and i am from kyiv romance was provided from the very path to the long awaited meeting to amazing landscapes which was hinged a fabulous mygia we had a weekend among nature wandered in the morning in local attractions he still turned out to be hiking and each time returning to the hotel with savage appetite they flew into dishes in a local restaurant and it was indescribably tasty gotel matok st pervomaiskaya migia mikolavsk region thirdly short travels in your country what could be more poetic especially when it comes to a completely new and outlandish place the name of which was heard for the first time a month before the trip i want to share such stories the quarantine opened many eyes about local travels i hope people retain the tradition of discovering those beauties that gives them life right now without waiting for external borders closed by the authorities and destroying their internal unnecessary constraining they will more often get out of the house and go to watch cities and sat down their land somewhere in migi full video about the weekend in this beautiful place here but i definitely recommend going by yourself and see everything with my own eyes thanks for olgamaslievich for creating this opportunity to share think and remember life again ps adventures are

,online,bilal12,homeschooling-in-the-context-of-a-pandemic-how-does-the-popular-family-cope-with-distance-education,HOMESCHOOLING IN THE CONTEXT OF A PANDEMIC: HOW DOES THE POPULAR FAMILY COPE WITH DISTANCE EDUCATION?,in venezuela since march a state of alarm decree has been in force that imposed the quarantine for in the national territory and the distance education methodology at all levels this context forced us the members of the team from the ucabs father luis azagra psychology unit upla to look for remote ways to maintain communication and as far as possible work with the families they had been receiving the psychological support service most of these families come from popular communities in the west of the city of caracas such as la vega carapita antiacutemano la yaguara and caricuao among others from the first weeks of the quarantine one of the first challenges we encountered in our work was to be able to generate spaces for virtual encounters with families we ran into a lot of resistance to continue the accompaniment processes by telephone constant refusals unanswered messages and postponements for another day or even for another week would we be approaching families inappropriately were we doing something wrong in our approach understanding the dynamics of what we understand as ldquomultiproblem familiesrdquo requires firstly having expertise in what these families experience and as another important element it also requires being able to see the contrasts with our experiences as workers in the mental health thus we understood that for us despite our common shortcomings as city dwellers the anguish we reflected was not similar to that of these families after numerous insistences the families began to show us how difficult it is to obtain what is necessary they started letting us know that something is missing and as we resumed the bond that was interrupted by the quarantine families were letting us know that they faced greater challenges in using their personal resources in meeting their daily demands this is due to the fact that teleworking or the search for economic income to support them and the emotional implications of a pandemic in a multiproblematic family context are now added to the difficulty in satisfying their basic needs some mothers easily express one of the most common reactions in this situation anxiety about an uncertain future around the economy the next school year or how to face a medical emergency considering the state of the health system when going out in search of food or work anguish prevails over the contagion and the possible consequences of it due to distrust of the health system on the other hand staying at home in ldquothis confinementrdquo has highlighted the emotional mobilization of them and their children despair sadness fear and anger at times seem to be the protagonists families also make great efforts to maintain control and constantly seek possible solutions thus the future and not just the present becomes overwhelming an overwhelming context although the focus of our interventions is in the accompanying children in their processes of adaptation to the school and academic experience as well as addressing difficulties and promoting the necessary adaptations for the development of capacities of our usersndash serving families in the context of quarantine has meant a shift in the prioritization of our interventions as psychologists we had to recognize the limits of our work to be able to rebuild and recover the processes that for years had already been consolidated with many of our users in this sense the discomfort and anguish that the families reflected to us at times were distancing themselves from the boys and girls and were turning over the country on numerous occasions they highlighted the difficulties in accessing basic resources such as water electricity or gas even to pay for food it was a difficulty to get what was necessary for these families the quarantine has meant being in a state of vulnerability and lack of resources not only financial but also support and containment networks all responsibility for care which in principle we understand as a responsibility that corresponds to government institutions also falls on the family nucleus and in particular on the figure of mothers who have also been our sources of contact conversation and i work in this period along with the difficulties of the context those who decide to attend to the day to day and downplay what will happen do not feel exactly hopeful but neither do they feel anxious in some cases mothers question their feelings and relegate their emotions to the background since taking care of daily tasks at home and outside of it in their context consumes most of their energy however in conditions like the current ones discouragement and despair do not take long to be noticed against which the attachment to religion and faith are protective factors to sustain them the complexities of homeschooling i have no patience i have no patience at allnbsp i get intense and i try to do things to himrdquo inside the home the pressures for these mothers involve new activities such as ldquordquo many of these women told us that for them the teachers send activities but they are not present and the mothers perceive a new need to be solved the context urges them once again to reinvent themselves whether or not they are ready to take on this role the anxiety about assuming even more responsibilities increases and questions arise around school assignments how to do them how to correct their children and concern about paying for some school supplies in this sense one of the mothers told us we have used the money we have to be able to pay them and sometimes we do not have either thousand on a piece of paper and they say to use the notebooks but how does the little boy do that he has already run out of the notebook thus another stressor emerges for mothers and children and sometimes for the nuclear and extended family the need to catch up with homework to avoid delays in the formal education of their children joseacute javier salas director of the ucab school of education in an interview with el ucabista expresses that considering the current situation ldquoschool lag is inevitable however even if this is a fact the implications of this lag and assuming it from the perspective of the mothers who have been accompanied implies longterm consequences that at times we are not willing to consider the concern about the lag is also an expression of what educational development means for the families with whom we work feeling that the time to educate is lost is for many of these women the loss of a sustained effort at the family level so that their children can improve their living conditions the lag in this sense is experienced as a denial of the possibility of accessing social mobility considering that the educational level of the parents is an important factor in the education of their children some mothers must make greater efforts to support school activities since they do not have sufficient academic preparation this sometimes contributes to increased worry and frustration one of the mothers showed it to us saying its hard not being able to help the child from here we will both graduaterdquo frustration doesnt necessarily turn into inaction the search for support networks with family members nuclear or extended has been beneficial for some of the mothers in the work of continuing with the educational training of their children we do everything with a cell phone and she is the one who knows how to use it at least i dont know how to search ldquoanother mother told us in some homes the need to establish routines arose parents avoid neglecting their obligations work or not while attending to and trying to achieve this through meeting schedules thus they seem to give meaning to a chaotic reality that requires abandoning the spaces that articulate the day to day the home is reconfigured those spaces that are usually outside are moved becoming at the same time an office school and recreation area along the same lines the roles are transformed generating confusion parents do not stop being parents but they become teachers and likewise children become students but at home mothers show us how they are demanding in terms of the academic process and how they also face their own limitations of children in some cases they express that children are ldquolazy bored want to play when they do homework or show difficulties in concentrating they observe the behaviors of their children and look for alternatives to improve academic performance however this seems not to be enough for these mothers it is not just about creating play spaces new routines and places to work the need for specialized attention to the limitations and resources of each of their children continues this sometimes becomes a situation that exceeds them ldquoi dont know what to do with it anymore i try but it is difficult for him to concentrate and he wants to play all the timerdquo ldquowith andreacutes they sent him tasks and it is a process for him to do them i have no patience i have no patience for anything he starts crying because one tells him that it is wrong and he has to erase itrdquo according to the parents in this situation it was easy for some children to understand as a vacation period perhaps consequently many families understand this attitude as ldquolazinessrdquo a preference for playing and in general a lack of willingness to carry out school assignments since not attending school is usually synonymous with vacations or rest it is a fact that mothers show they feel demanded in terms of the academic process however each one channels this feeling differently for example in contrast to a mother who makes an effort to get her sons participation another also concerned about meeting the demands chooses to carry out most of the activities assuming with some resignation that her son does not feel willing to do so take part indistinctly once again the mother assumes the greatest responsibility while assigning the child shorter or less complex tasks he gets distracted or starts thinking about movies i get intense and i try to do things to him he just copies them these may be the typical or usual approaches at home prior to the period of confinement however it is worth thinking how the current situation exacerbates these feelings of demand impatience resignation since clearly the role of teacher becomes even more important the psychological task in quarantine since the beginning of the quarantine numerous psychological initiatives have emerged around the world to deal with what it can mean to stay at home raising educating living together and community conditions of each particular story assuming that our job is to support people to find relief from their suffering the context of quarantine questioned us in multiple ways how can we do our work without having facetoface contact with families can psychology contribute to improvement in these circumstances the families showed us again and again how the psychological recommendations in quarantine and the universal recipes for mental health had clear limits in their experiences since the vulnerability and precariousness in which they find themselves are deeply stressful factors and in many cases also potentially traumatic events given the numerous recommendations that we managed to compile from different sources and places we saw how each attempt to establish a new ldquopracticerdquo or ldquoroutinerdquo from our knowledge fell apart as days went by we saw the limitations to have a phone call because in many cases digital media whatrsquos app zoom skype are not available and suggesting them is also a source of shame we dont have that here these impositions of a reality different from ours invited us to resort to the most unique element of psychological and therapeutic work listening in our own anguish to seek the wellbeing and support of families it was the families who made us return to the basics of our work without resorting to shortcuts tips or decontextualized practices listening has undoubtedly been the engine of our interventions,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://steemitimages.com/DQmSgj8EzgJC9bKUEk43ES4xfoVj4pzJW4z5Z2BkYidCdgR/aaaaaaaaaaa.png"",""cover_image"":""https://steemitimages.com/DQmaeQZqDDS9ALs8uJ6ybctekKeeXS5xWtqRFENh1yNpbLQ/download.jpg"",""name"":""Bilal

cranesdinds there jpg well it was almost not going to the beach we have to go back to the street and then the whole group and up again and up until then in the parking lot upstairs the bloose suddenly

unique when i write about me i always try to be myself i try myself to be candid caprice passionate honest hardworking and contented i live honestly and work hard to attain all things that i want to achieve my name is mercus and i comes from a very beautiful and historical city lahore which one of the capital cities of pakistan i got my master degree in physics from gc university lahore which is one of the renown institution of my country currentlyi am doing my mphill in nuclear physics as well as some different courced in the field of computer science and information technology the fist goal of my life is to establish a welfare educational institute for poor and needy children and my inspiration for that comes from the society where i see poor and downtrodden children doing labour job i really feel pain for them and think to change their condition with whatever means i have whenever i come across a little child doing child labour at a hotel or at a brick kiln i really feel sorry for it and think taht he should not be there rather he should be at school taht thing inspires me alot to so something for the lower traye of society i am a realistic and optimistic person and i can find hope in the darkness my favourite movie is taray zameen par means starts on earth it is a bollywood movie and the theme of the movie revolves aroud the solution of our day to day problems i pend most of my time in reading good books my favourite book is lessons for century written by yuval noah harari in whicj he predict about future and advise the people to take strong actions to deal with future a part from that i like anothet good book that is jonathan livingston seagal in which a seagal first learn how to fly and later on he teaches the lesson to other rebel seagals who want to break the barriers of traditional living many people have dreams to become a doctor an engineer or law expert like them i always wanted to become a software engineer currently i am unable to recall when i fell in love with this field but over the years my passion for this field has increased in the past few months of pandemic i have started living this passion and i think this gives me pleasure i have

but he is unable to earn from all of the content he uploads shares or likes whole on the othet hand streem it knows that every persons content and time is valuable so they created a revolutionary

JAPÓN., hello friends i hope that your weekend is going as well as mine on this occasion i will tell you that since childhood i have always had a great fascination for asian culture especially japanese culture so within my plans is to visit this country so i will dedicate myself to highlighting the aspects of this country that from my point of view they seem interesting japan it is an insular country of oriental asia located in the northwest of the pacific ocean includes an archipelago of islands that cover square kilometers the five main islands of the country from north to south are hokkaid honsh shikoku kysh and okinawa tokyo is the largest capital and city in japan the most populous metropolitan area in the world with more than thirty seven million residents the most spoken language in japan is the japanese which is divided into several dialects and the tokyo dialect is considered standard japanese i have always admired japan as a culture much of the westerners have been strongly influenced by their culture mostly observed in anime printed cartoons where they express their love for art for nature for order and discipline discipline for the aspects that stand out as a culture that range from their ancient traditions ways of dressing meals and way of relating to each other combatirladespoblacionjpg japanese culture is highly avant garde more than of its land is mountainous so its coastal areas are highly populated forcing them to have artificial islands creation projects japan is substantially prone to earthquakes tsunamis and volcanoes due to its location along the pacific fire ring so it is very common for its inhabitants to feel the earthquakes frequently also thanks to these have one of the greatest advances in geological studies and develops antisismic structures as for economics we can emphasize that japan is the third world economy after the us and china it has a capitalist model with an low unemployment rate below its main exports are transport equipment motor vehicles products products iron and steel semiconductors and car components itok well we could highlight many interesting aspects of this beautiful country and culture but my publication would be very extensive so i will comment in a condensed way what has captivated me most of the japanese landscapes i always captivated the landscapes shown both is his works of arts and in his films and animations language one of the most complex languages to learn art and traditions for its attachment to its history its culture japan has merged its development as a country with its history and traditions the manifestation of their customs from their oldest works to their anime and music fashion one of the cultures with the most investment in the fashion sector together with the us and europe gastronomy in japan the consumption of meat is expensive so your diet is high in plant and marine products technology as mentioned above this sector forms part of its economic development through exports can be seen from its architectural development to its way of living daily such as video games software development itok timestamp imgtopicsjapaneseanimeseriesjp greaters japon an millenary culture that captivates and intrigues falls in love and impacts when you look even more closely for these reasons and much more japan is among the countries i want to visit i thank

,hive-143575,oldstone,4dif1e,"<한반도비핵화, 북한비핵화 모두 말장난이다>",the moon jae in regime argues that north korea should be solved by dialogue because north korea is willing to denuclearize suddenly the biden administration insists that north korea should denuclearize not denuclearization on the korean peninsula both north koreas denuclearization or the korean peninsula nuclearization is far from the nature of the problem the reason north korea insisted on denuclearization of the korean peninsula is because the nuclear weapons were stationed on the korean peninsula of course it is not just because the us military is stationed in korea north korea believes that as long as the united states has a military alliance with south korea the united states can intervene on the korean peninsula at any time it is to insist on the nuclearization of the korean peninsula because the united states can use nuclear weapons at any time when military intervention on the korean peninsula can be used at any time in other words denuclearization of the korean peninsula that north korea thinks is ultimately a state in which the united states is cut off of military alliance with south korea for north korea the united states is guaranteed that the united states does not attack north korea with the protection of south korea on the other hand the denuclearization of the korean peninsula that south korea thinks is really naive literally south korea or north korea means no nuclear weapons the problem is that such a state cannot exist this is because north korea considers denuclearization of the korean peninsula when the united states cuts off military relations with south korea and does not have a threat to use of foreign nuclear weapons in that sense north korea will claim that his nuclear weapons are guaranteed for the nuclearization of the korean peninsula the reason why north korea claims to denuclearize north korea not the korean peninsulas nuclearization means that north korea must be denuclearized the problem is that north koreas denuclearization is not possible in any method or case north korea has a nuclear weapon to be free from any external interference in addition as time goes by there is a growing environment for north korea as the us china hegemony competition has begun north koreas ransom is rising when the united states and china paired with each other the united states tried to denuclearize north korea under the condition of north korea under the influence of china in other words the united states thought it was advantageous if only north koreas nuclear weapons were eliminated under the condition of tibetatization north korea has blocked all of chinas attempt to overthrow the kim jong un regime it seems that almost all of the forces that could be chinas steaming forces have been purged most of the internal purges that kim jong un took over power and occurred should be regarded as eliminating the influence of china the representative figure is jang sung taek of course i think kim jong nam was killed as the united states and china competed north korea became a very precious being for china if the united states captures north korea china is a serious situation if you think that all nuclear weapons in north korea are facing china you will be able to predict how serious situations are the united states blows all that opportunity the united states did not know exactly whether it was the most important i dont know if i thought i could deploy nuclear weapons aimed at china in south korea and japan it is impossible to deploy us nuclear weapons in japan and korea no regime is difficult to survive in the judgment of the people the only way for the united states to deploy nuclear weapons in japan and south korea is the method of having nuclear weapons in japan and south korea so what would happen if japan had a nuclear weapon japan which has nuclear weapons will never be japan after world war ii in that case japan is much more likely to return to japan before world war ii rather it was much more advantageous to turn north korea to his side in this way the korean peninsulas nuclearization and denuclearization of north korea are nothing but meaningless investigation the essence of the problem is somewhere else the united states has taken this situation without seeing the moon south korea did not think about what was in line with his interests but he just broke up in this situation north korea is the only north korean to understand the situation north korea is to evaluate the situation calmly and accurately because

of beauty isnt he in the sky thousands of star sapphires are burning and extinguishing if you notice a little you can see that a lighted road like light clear clouds has flowed through the middle of the sky this is our milky way galaxy all the stars seen with the naked eye and all the stars observed with the naked eye are members of this milky way galaxy money the english word galaxy comes from the greek word galaxias kyklos if you do it in bengali it becomes chayapath chakra greek mythology says that when the goddess juno was breastfeeding the baby hercules some of the milk from junos breast was sprinkled with finki from which the galaxy was born according to greek mythology the goddess juno splashed some milk while feeding the baby hercules giving birth to the milky way galaxy hence its name is via lactea whose english synonym is milky way meanwhile the bengali term milky way has been changed to akashganga born about crore years ago the unimaginable temperature and unbearable pressure caused a landmark event the big bang hydrogen and helium are formed within to million years of the big bang these two atomic cosmic clouds were floating in space at that time gradually billions of bubbles are formed by the gravitational pull inside the cloud under unbearable pressure the bubbles produce a minimum temperature of million degrees celsius and the hydrogen atom breaks down into helium this process is called nuclear fusion this nuclear fusion releases huge amounts of energy the bubbles turn into a single burning star these galaxies are huge galaxies including billions upon billions of stars galaxies come in many shapes and sizes depending on the speed of rotation galaxies that have higher rotational speeds on their own axes become like flattened plates the rest also come in different shapes depending on the speed of rotation some like eggs some like spirals some like spirals some like random there are about billion such galaxies in the visible universe one of which is our milky way the milky way is a spiral galaxy it has a few curved arms like the blades of a table fan there is disagreement about the number of arms however here are the main five arms ma norma arm sagittarius arm perseus arm scutumcentaurus arm outer arm our solar system is in a relatively small arm or spar of the milky way its name is orion spur what is this milky way the milky way galaxy is flat like a disc or hard disk unimaginable huge distance from head to toe in this galaxy even if you travel at the speed of light it will take about lakh light years to reach the other end thickness is so deadly a total of thousand light years the milky way galaxy contains an estimated to billion stars the sun is a middle class star among them some cosmic objects revolve around one of these stars for example there are seven mainstream planets many asteroids and comets orbiting our sun the satellites are revolving around the planet again this is the massive arrangement around a star called the planetary system and especially this arrangement of our sun and its surroundings is called solar system or solar system many systems have two stars orbiting each other this is called binary system most of the binary systems in the milky way if our jupiter was a little bigger the solar system would also become a binary system astronomers have so far identified planets in our milky way and theyre guessing that our milky way could have to billion planets central blackhole office now the thing is that no matter what the solar system planetary system or binary system they are not fixed at the center of our galaxy is a monstrous black hole sagittarius a the monster is sitting in the center of the galaxy with a mass equal to about million solar masses all the stars in the entire galaxy including their systems are orbiting this black hole the distance of our solar system from this black hole is about thousand light years and our solar system takes only million years to orbit this black hole the milky way galaxy rotates on its own axis at a speed of kilometers per second being relatively densely populated the majority of the area near the black hole is inhabited by older and older stars the oldest star in the milky way is cayrels star and the age of this old man is approximately twelve and a half billion years thanks for reading the

the constitutional court held a constitutional appeal judgment on article paragraph self abortion and paragraph consent abortion which was the punishment of abortion and the constitutional appeal on the of the nine judges there were only two constitutional opinions three unconstitutional judges and four constitutional inconsistencies were virtually unclean constitutional discrepancy is a decision to maintain the provisions until the relevant law is amended after the law presupposes that it is unconstitutional it is clear that the criminal law that defines abortion crimes is unconstitutional but it is an order to maintain it only until the revision of the criminal law in that it may be social confusion if it is immediately suspended the decision of the constitutional court which caused endless controversy over the past years is likely to disappear into history in fact the deletion of punishment provisions is inevitable because it is actually the unconstitutional decision in addition legal opinions from the constitutional court in were also lagged in seven years on the day the judges respected womens right to self determination and suggested that abortion should be allowed in the early stages of pregnancy and that punishment for the early pregnancy abortion violated the constitution as a result the revision of the law is expected to continue to be controversial about how far pregnancy is recognized meanwhile prior to the decision of the constitution religious and civic groups insisted on maintaining abortion in front of the court in particular the conflict over the law is expected to lead to the moment of revision of the regulations in that the regulation itself will be abolished if the law fails to revise the law by december meanwhile the obstetrics and gynecology

,japan,mike2004,xuysp-ntt,NTTの政官接待とドコモ完全子会社化について, needs the following is a collection of related links that are already open and the story of a delusional person furthermore since it is transmitted from the whistleblower position please divide the story if you keep in mind this entry article should be neutral all of this entry article are delusions please be careful not to receive it and read it with care impressions the problem is that ntt goods has entertained ministers politics and bureaucrats officials understanding the role of ntt in japanese society was that the typical adhesion structure of the government and government was clear and there was no surprise ntt is a semi public and semi private special company and has a privilege based on public interest with the empty building aside ntt reverses public money with telecommunications infrastructure as a hostage to take the government official the job of the government is to constantly watch the presence or absence of special capital of the shelf butter intermittently judges the suitability of the competitive environment and to deregulate and reinforce regulation the accumulated special capital is a consumer overpayment but ntt is not ashamed of earning its own even though the reduction of special capital is a job the government like ntt is not aware of consumer overpayment on april it is advancing that telecommunications operators submitted a statement for the truth from the ministry of internal affairs and communications information and communications administrative verification committee however the truth will never be clear the ministry of internal affairs and communications in the telecommunications business in the ministry of internal affairs and communications is not caught by self binding because all three are in the ministry of internal affairs and communications i want to believe in justice that has confronted criminal acts against the national interests of the information and communications administrative verification committee former lawyer formerly a special prosecutor by the way the chairman of the special investigation committee launched by ntt is ntt outside directors ntts report is not worth reading if you do not have time to read we introduced three youtube programs in related links below i want you to grasp the whole scandal even if you are vague consideration is it violent to replace the information and communication council as an extra lets take a look at the role of the study of the political and public affairs media of telecommunications mura report correspondence business law law market verification return to report is a typical process and study leads the direction of telecommunications policy there is no opinion in the latest report the new information and technology strategy strategy at least the conversion of docomos company report on verification of competition rules october e communication market verification meeting has verified the competitive environment below partial excerpts report on verification of competition rules asaly of mobile market future direction communication market in the future the area is expected to be reduced in charge and diversification of services through further competition by the ingenuity of each business operator it is necessary to verify whether the competition is functioning effectively and that there are any elements that hinder competition it is necessary to identify factors that hinder fair competition and repeat analysis and verification so that they provide low easy to understand and satisfactory services throughout the competition it has been pointed out that the level of communication charges should be analyzed in conjunction with communication quality etc and studied methods in foreign countries and private sector business status the operating margin of mno companies is around each company the operating profit margin of the listed agency is less than of the operating profit ratio of all industries as a reference indicator for analyzing and verifying a fair competitive environment the trend will continue to be watched in the future there was an open opinion exchange but in october there was no opinion to support docomo complete subsidiary indeed the information and communication council was clown as before there is no change that the fair competitive environment is important and we will continue to look at the trends in the future the people must judge the political decisions that have been tolerated for the formation of docomo to promote a fair competitive environment as a consensus of government and government the electricity family nict can earn foreign currency infrastructure export to enhance ntt and challenge the huawei it is a sincere attitude to carefully explain the audit to have domestic mobile phone operators cry an example dont forget that there was a political judgment that promoted the opposite docomo complete subsidiary while proclaiming to achieve the purpose a fair competitive environment i thought about the scenario of success and failure the success electric family leads the global market of infrastructure and foreign currency tricks down from the electricity family to circulate in the country the optical fiber wholesale fee is reduced and the whole internet market including the mobile phone business is activated the failure electric family cannot lead the global market of infrastructure and does not have the operating profit of the electricity family the optical fiber wholesale fee is raised and the whole internet market including the mobile phone business is inactive naturally i pray that japanese companies will be active globally however the cost of a huge expenditure of r d and marketing is a fare from the whole japan internet market even if you succeed you must be humble by consumers in the unlikely event that the ntt family fails there is room for the ntt family to continue exploiting from the internet market the consensus of the government and government is the second tepco business model delusion for non residents with uneven telecommunications it is only a high risk middle return not the risk low risk middle returns for the inhabitants of electric communications there will be no huge lending to a special company that will not be crushed trillion yen after the tob of docomo the new year was issued by the review meeting report on the securing fair competition march ministry of internal affairs and communications fair trade commission on the way of securing fair competition there is at the beginning i was surprised at the reason why the public hearing was after docomos tob end there are no special legal restrictions that hinder the rise in the investment ratio there is a specialty of the case of stock purchases such as having a significant impact on the stock market a report that only recognizes established facts as a result of the hearing after the fact it has been previously announced that the government should deny the ntts docomos company shareholder representative lawsuit as a shareholder one third to ensure fair competition position of it looks like a report that aims to remove gas with four telecommunications companies there are fresh hearing answers from competitors and concerns have been organized once again it is no wonder that a competitor submitted an opinion on april the fair competitive environment has been set up now its the beginning of a new competition smiling proposal i cant trust ntt dont trust verify follow the money it is not possible to have a huge special company of semi government semi private even if you use billion yen of sales every year to follow the ntt group annual sales of about trillion yen you must continue to audit and supervise the entire corporate activity especially expenditure you can find more than billion yen eg political donation unidentified a labor cost scholars and experts and media measures over advertising expenses prosage we believe that an nponpo for audits and directors is needed to be serious about endless continuity although the purpose is different a hardcore npo like the information disclosure clearing house becomes a model although it is a harmful effect of privatization it will be difficult to disclose information from a semi governmental special company it is not limited to ntt but is a common issue for special companies bonus since i joined the company my heart hurts when i think of my seniors and colleagues who have been taken care of except for a few exceptions all employees are good employees the ntt whistle blowing window which would have been forced to respond to the organizations logic was a demon with no human language the same is true for the ministry of internal affairs and communicationss public interest reporting in order to confront a huge organization as an individual whistleblower had to be a demon i regret having no room to accumulate trust in the other persons feelings i am convinced that leaving a record will contribute to national interests reference information disclosure clearing house information

,kr,sanha88,52aep2,아기농장의 아기들이 템즈강에 던져지기까지 .,until the babies of the baby farms are thrown into the thames river at the end of the century england was in its peak the british empire which was unfolded from hong kong to the bahama islands was shined forever but when i looked inside england was also suffering from a huge contradiction in the mid century london was particularly serious with a population of million and emerging as the worlds largest city the city that accommodated a population that could not afford more than a garden passenger was in a bog while desperate air of poverty prevailed young children had to jump into the lines and parents could not take care of their children properly the children who grew up in such an environment were easily stained by crime and the lack of hope was to knock down the people by spreading the wings of poison on july a woman named emily cums was found in british slum east london she was years old a mother who raised her twelve year old brothers in front of the police her eldest son robert confesses that she killed her mother robert and his brother lived for over a week leaving their mothers body i enjoyed the abundance of my mothers goods in the pawn shop robert replied to the police who were astonished i had no choice but to kill my brother with an ax the mother who was in a hard life regarded her child as a hungry and in front of her violence she became a guardian of her younger brother robert is rarely trapped in a mental hospital as a wicked and madman children were born but they were overflowing with those who could not afford the minimum care for them even if i killed it it was done from time to time children on the street were also gone charles dickens oliver twist was published in and this novel is criticized for the new guinfin law which was enacted in it was malthus who provided the ideological foundation of this law malthus thought that poverty occurred due to the poor people who had sexual desire without the ability to support in other words the new guinfin law was a law that was established on the principle that poverty should be overcome by their own efforts and temperance not social relief and that social intervention should be minimal in this situation it is not difficult to estimate what children born between men and women who do not want to be parents were treated contraceptive pills and contraception methods were not developed properly so an unintentional child was born everywhere parents who do not have to raise children and mothers who are in danger of being kicked out of the workplace have no choice but to give up their children or give up their children like emily kums mentioned above as a result baby farming which receives a fee from an unfortunate parents entrusts children and adopts infertility families or a child who wants a child has emerged as a pretty profitable business amelia diary who worked as a nurse and a midwife jumped into this business in after her husband died she advertises these advertisements in local newspapers a couple with a good house for all adopt a healthy child but instead of providing safe and lovely assumptions the der began to kill the children after paying only fees in the mid century he overdose the childrens sleeping pills the nickname moms friend which was made to silence children in the mid century and killed or starved she went out to the far away areas such as liverpool and plimus as well as near her home attracted children and took away their lives if the tail was long it was stepped on and even a dyer was almost caught doctors caught the fact that her children died too much in but doctors did not think that she had intentionally killed the children and only received six months of labor for alleged neglect that she had not taken care of her since then the diary has changed the way i decided to relieve the hard work of receiving a death certificate from a doctor in the dyer moved to reading near the thames river killing the children and began to abandon them in the river the carcasses of unfortunate children wandered around the black thames with garbage and wastewater and flowed into the sea of eternal forgetfulness the diarys plan was perfect on march until the lash ship picked up a bizarre package wrapped in a brown wrapping paper sagong who stumbled the row and pulled out the packaging was frightened and dropped its because the hand of a child but a person who is a person has popped out the police who have been reported by sagong find a crucial clue while investigating the wrapping paper wrapped around the body it was an article that allows you to estimate the personal information of the diary with the central railway bristol bank finally the diary was arrested the police found an additional body of six children after looking around the thames river when these children are also abandoned the der replies if im killed im going to wash the white strap around my neck the police officers who heard this would have experienced their hair standing all six bodies were covering their necks but i couldnt tell exactly how many joints i had killed my joints for about years after the baby farm business dyer tried to avoid the death penalty while pretending to be a mandarin but was not accepted and ended his ugly life at the faculty in in the british society where structural contradictions were tong and used to use children as a means of transactions the emergence of the demon called amelia diary was inevitable i dont know if human beings are originally good or evil but human evil is a way to dig into the weak rings of human beings not long ago a demon like demon appeared in korea after adopting jung in who has been in the world for less than two years he sent to heaven after the pain of breaking the pancreas of the child in it is necessary to remember that many of the specialty winners of apartments in seoul and the seoul metropolitan area have made false adoption with brokers for multiple childrens benefits how many people the universe and their future and possibilities are losing and losing maybe its like the british before the identity of the diary is revealed what would happen to robert who killed her mother above he is so young that he is executed and he is released in years after receiving great healing and caring in the treatment center after immigrating to australia he participated in world war i since then he has become a guardian of harry mulville a boy who suffered domestic violence and mulville has built a tombstone of robert who lived alone without getting married the tombstone was written harry mulville and his family who always remember him written by the wicked boy kate summer scale pyeong ah who killed her mother can be a savior who pulls someone else from the hollow of unhappy such beings are human no matter what it happens no matter what situation you are in a situation you shouldnt throw away your faith in humanity this is why a society should not give up intervention in unfortunate children

,hive-180932,ancient-light,6wb1im,守拙之道,in modern politics if a rookie is outstanding and the art pressure it will definitely be praised and it will be crowned with beautiful names such as politics star and leaders in people however the logic followed by traditional politics is exactly the opposite people who show the mountains and dew shouldnt it be dangerous one of the most valuable political wisdoms that have been inherited for thousands of years of inheritance is i will follow the way of clumsy is it true that you are so important to be so valued in the country and benefit yourself born in shouzhuang the literati likes to call his work clumsy and naturally believes that it is so humble this type of usage is more usage making the word clumsy also seem to be cunning and deliberately cover up its old success meaning with its stupid appearance however the original meaning of clumsy is not aging however the person who is clumsy in history seems to have a little sense of clumsy in the virtuousness not just to keep the natural clumsy imagine how can a person who is really awkward achieved a great cause and is famous for his history how can the descendants come up with a clumsy example lets do this first so as not to look at the word clumsy moreover i cant change the term clumsy to pretending to be clumsy or showing their clumsy as for how the princes in the history look at the following i can see the wisdom as much as possible xiao he the people who are accustomed to reading martial arts novels must be very puzzled how did xiao he become liu bangs first hero does he have the a little bit of cutting off this is exactly what liu bangs extraordinary is although he is a rude township husband he knows how to manage the country he can be one less member of the general if xiao he is less what will happen to the situation it is hard to say xiao he originally had a county official how much met the world once i was in charge of the world as the prime minister there were countless things in my heart can he be stupid however that the heart of the world is difficult to use to calculate liu bangs seat this is exactly what liu bang cant rest assured the tragedy of chinas thousands of years of political history is exactly here once the king has the world the first enemy in his heart is the second figure next to him if xiao he is clumsy he will not think of this and needs others to remind him regardless of whether he was conscious or reminded he seemed to have no ambition before liu bangs face and he had a wide range of aspirations and he had a wide range of fields and he was eager to enjoy it this kind of clumsy method is also considered good zeng guofan zeng guofan after being the first minister of zte seems to be an indisputable great hero but he himself has a rare self knowledge he understood that he was not tianyongying and admitted that he rely on hardships and desperate to achieve such a scale in his book he repeatedly warned his children and future generations to read keep karma and be a man it is not ashamed that he often sets up the old foundation in the early ten years of cold windows in front of a group of young students in yuelu academy his old student has no advantages only by doubled hard work will he not be later on others he started a group of scholars and pulled up the xiang armys team and finally swept half of china no one has said that he is a militaryist but he has really won an unprecedented scale of war li yuanhong dont always describe the rumors of the leader of the uprising from the undercar to describe the black li yuanhong li yuanhong is not enthusiastic about rebellion but it is not so unbearable in any case after all people who have worked for a few years of president cannot do so of course compared with the great president like yuan shikai li yuanhong is indeed far away some people even call him li bodhisattva behind him probably enough when the hubei supervisory army was a little bit angry and said nothing he was still not awesome after making the old president that is his waist pole was not hard when a military strong man like duan qirui was not embarrassed when he was the prime minister when he couldnt bear it he refused to build president da yin on duans official document at other times his only resistance method was to ignore it and he really became the li bodhisattva chen yun since the date of the soviet union returned to the country chen yun has been a politician his persistence and persistence are reflected in the a little mysterious silence and the silence is gold in the chen was a vice chairman who had already hanged the wall but among ordinary people how many people know how big chen yun is few people know what he said what to fight and what he survived it is enough to be clumsy only in a short period of time after the seven thousand people conferences he seemed no longer so clumsy and actually proposed that economic adjustment must be returned this is certainly unacceptable leader faced with the upcoming thunderous counterattack chen yuns response is still the old method go home and go home to cultivate perhaps because of this he finally spent the ten years of the cultural revolution of dangerous and waves the above four people of course are far away from people can they have commonality it seems that at least one thing is almost common that is not publicity so is this the stubbornness that this article is concerned about it seems that it is not exactly like and maybe more appropriate expression is tao dian ly this is exactly the effort that some big people advocated however i still decided not to use the word tanto not all of them but in todays context the word tao yan shows more good calculations and this kind of feminine kung fu is far away from the clumsy dead in zhang yang the zhang yang which is opposed to clumsy is very revealing and there is no possibility of misunderstanding moreover it is an indisputable derogatory term and the derogation has been exposed literally so zhang yangs people must be ugly in fact it may not be necessary the two people below should not be ranked among the characters in the negative han xin he and xiao hewen are martial arts which is liu bangs left arm and right arm han xin gong chased xiao he and his style was very different and the end was different but to say that han xinzhang yang yang it seems that it will not be publicized at least in the early years the person who is willing to climb from others is not just publicity it is almost tolerated however after all han xin is a martial arts which is destined that he does not catch the prime minister who is not like the sea on the political stage he will definitely show his original color and this expression must be equivalent to his strength how can the martial arts always hide their heads when they are fighting then in the officialdom the martial artss dull kung fu must be dwarfed han xin was not as public when he worshiped the general he was revealed in the center of the army and the first achievement of solo did not be public this is something that people who want to build meritorious workers but as soon as he captured qi state he proposed to be king showing that liu bang used his true desire and it was not public it was precisely this step to laid the root of his ending liu bangs old conspiracy and tao weili were manifested in this matter if liu bang is not invisible and does not send it and meets han xins request he gives strict words and rejected causing han xin to be angry and fighting in court nevertheless han xin still has a faithful follower and indispensable stock man who is a faithful follower liu bang who has already sat in the world finally abolished han xins king and seized his land it would not be said that it would be difficult for the emperor to do this kind of thing but it is not necessary to cut off the heros head it can be seen that whether it is liu bang or zhu yuanzhang this kind of person is not worth the heroes to fight the world can people in the world realize this truth if so how can there be han xin from generation to generation rather than saying that han xins misfortune is the disaster of publicity it is better to say that it is specially made luo ruiqing he is not a modern han xin and he has not opened up half of the rivers but his power in his heyday was not under han xin of that year during the war luo was a soldier level figure he was awarded the general in he served as the minister of public security the most important role in letting him go is nothing more than maos bodyguard his loyalty and diligence can be said to be impeccable in peng dehuais difficulty was the beginning of luo fa he became the chief of staff and became the highest army of actual responsibility since then he has stepped down at the end of he has more and more positions his power is getting bigger and bigger and the style is getting more and more public luos title includes deputy prime minister chief of staff secretary general of the military commission deputy secretary of defense minister of public security director of the national defense science and technology commission he has three heads and six arms and he cannot take this position in the case of mao lin luo shi is actually the commander of the three armed forces to what extent can its moxibustion hands be hot it can be imagined moreover luo is not the kind of person who works simply the habit of his political workers and cadres is particularly keen on building momentum no matter how he intends to work in the eyes of others he must not have the meaning of personal publicity at that time the generals in the army were like a cloud and those who were qualified military level and prestige were unknown even if luo is low key he may not be able to hold the moon and luo should have high profile rights and it can be imagined how much anger is attracted of course these do not constitute the main cause of luos failure the person you like no matter how big the slander is it is not the same but once fell out of favor it will be undoubted in early mao only moved a little finger and knocked down his most intimate love the charges on the facade are against comrade lin biao and the real reason may never be known whatever search i couldnt find that luo was disrespectful to the leader how risks to the mao officer are luos end can explain the problem best who can solve this mystery in modern chinese history luo ruiqing may really cause trouble because of publicity but he cant help but doubt the heavy cloud a person in the officialdom after observing the success or failure of many historical figures how to make a choice about keeping clumsy and publicity can the mentioned born in clumsy and died in zhang yang can be regarded as a historical conclusion this question is not easy to answer first of all two situations must be distinguished personal destiny and social interests the two are obviously different the initial observation focused on personal destiny a person in the power field is two different orientations does the two have a strong degree of correlation with personal destiny in an autocratic society the answer should be sure those who keep their clumsy may not be officially transported but they must have a greater security probability and the probability of achieve great cause is small conversely zhang yangs people may not cause trouble but they must have greater risks and low security probability but it is more likely to have outstanding performance all these causality should be understood in the sense of nature and there is no inevitable conclusion among the senior people zhang wentian also kept clumsy but it was the bumpy life of his life and he died until he could not get healed by the end guo moruos life was enough he was born with this temperament but it seemed that hongyun passed away with many prominent titles in he was so happy that he scolded chiang kai shek but at the beginning of the anti japanese war he arrived in chongqing and from time to time he had to see chiang kai shek and he didnt seem to encounter much risk from this point of view the relationship is also uncertain for the relationship between the clumsy and publicity to the personal destiny how to associate social interests the causality is even more obvious a preliminary observation is if there are too many praise and reputation to give the clumsy person then there are more cautious gentlemen but there must be fewer good men who are in trouble what about carrying the tripod if people who are overly sympathetic to luo ruiqing are not enough to encourage some people with power to smoke desperately grab the rights and seize power and when they are proud i do nt do anything wrong it seems that the proper conclusion should be that the clumsy and publicity in the officialdom may become a scourge once it becomes a certain climate therefore saying to keep clumsy is fulfilled to a certain extent no need to keep clumsy although the above analysis is not clearly emphasized it is actually only effective for autocracy if you are in a modern civilized society then peoples choices of their behavior patterns and evaluation of social popularity models will face completely different situations this difference caused by different social systems is not only enlightening but also very interesting first consider the choice of personal behavior mode think of it a appealing slogan in the may fourth period is personality liberation at that time the young people really embraced the new era with extremely enthusiasm in their eyes the main benefits of replacing the new era of the imperial era are not new items new costumes new etiquette new academics but freedom freedom first means personality liberation if i can choose the way of choosing a life based on my personality hobbies and pursuit wouldnt i be jia baoyu in grand view garden whether i choose to be restrained meditated taciturn indulgence humor playfulness funny arrogant frank i am all my freedom of personality so i can tolerate others in particular i can choose to keep their clumsy or zhang yang no matter what the advantages and disadvantages are it is my own business and i am willing to bear its consequences unfortunately the personal liberation of may has not been realized and later even seal the word liberation however the ideal peoples heart did not give up their longing for freedom this means that people can understand that in a free society individuals are pure private problems whether they choose to keep their clumsy or publicity and it cannot enter the category of moral judgment at all in a free society everyone faces the possibility of winning more and it is impossible to predict the choice of individuals as for society there are some laws in the statistical sense for example not many people choose to keep their clumsy because the choice is that it is restricted to themselves and this is unlikely to be a free society as for those considerations for personal safety it has lost its meaning perhaps this can explain why the oriental seemed to be restrained and cautious while the westerners were more frank and open orientals motto was everyone just speaks three points westerners favorite words are the most disadvantage of forgiveness is trust is this different from human nature of course not why dont you want to live in a more free and free atmosphere why dont you want to write a new motto for yourself dont keep clumsy

that struck the countrys natanz nuclear facility nuclear terrorism download by jon gambrell and ilan ben zion associated press dubai united arab emirates ap the head of irans civilian nuclear program has called a blackout that struck the countrys natanz nuclear facility nuclear terrorism ali akbar salehi made the comments in a report published online by iranian state television on sunday night he did not name a suspect in the sabotage his comments escalate current mideast tensions many israeli media outlets offered the same assessment that a cyberattack darkened natanz and damaged a facility that is home to sensitive centrifuges while the reports offered no sourcing for the evaluation israeli media maintains a close relationship with the countrys military and intelligence agencies this is a breaking news update aps earlier story follows below dubai united arab emirates ap irans underground natanz nuclear facility lost power sunday just hours after starting up new advanced centrifuges capable of enriching uranium faster the latest incident to strike the site amid negotiations over the tattered atomic accord with world powers as iranian officials investigated the outage many israeli media outlets offered the same assessment that a cyberattack darkened natanz and damaged a facility that is home to sensitive centrifuges while the reports offered no sourcing for the evaluation israeli media maintains a close relationship with the countrys military and intelligence agencies if israel caused the blackout it further heightens tensions between the two nations already engaged in a shadow conflict across the wider middle east it also complicates efforts by the us israels main security partner to reenter the atomic accord aimed at limiting tehrans program so it cant pursue a nuclear weapon as news of the blackout emerged us defense secretary lloyd austin landed sunday in israel for talks with prime minister benjamin netanyahu and israeli defense minister benny gantz power at natanz was cut across the facility which is comprised of aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls civilian nuclear program spokesman behrouz kamalvandi told iranian state television we still do not know the reason for this electricity outage and have to look into it further kamalvandi said fortunately there was no casualty or damage and there is no particular contamination or problem asked if it was a technical defect or sabotage kamalvandi declined to comment malek shariati niasar a tehranbased lawmaker who serves as spokesman for the iranian parliaments energy committee wrote on twitter that the incident was very suspicious raising concerns about possible sabotage and infiltration he said lawmakers were pursuing details of the incident the viennabased international atomic energy agency which monitors irans program said it was aware of the media reports but declined to comment natanz was built largely underground to withstand enemy airstrikes it became a flashpoint for western fears about irans nuclear program in when satellite photos showed iran building its underground centrifuges facility at the site some kilometers miles south of the capital tehran natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in july that authorities later described as sabotage iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain israel irans regional archenemy has been suspected of carrying out that attack as well as launching other assaults as world powers negotiate with tehran in vienna over its nuclear deal iran also blamed israel for the killing of a scientist who began the countrys military nuclear program decades earlier the stuxnet computer virus discovered in and widely believed to be a joint usisraeli creation once disrupted and destroyed iranian centrifuges at natanz its hard for me to believe its a coincidence yoel guzansky a senior fellow at tel avivs institute for national security studies said of sundays blackout if its not a coincidence and thats a big if someone is trying to send a message that we can limit irans advance and we have red lines it also sends a message that irans most sensitive nuclear site is penetrable he added israel has not claimed any of the attacks though netanyahu repeatedly has described iran as the major threat faced by his country in recent weeks meeting with austin on sunday gantz said israel viewed america as an ally against all threats including iran the tehran of today poses a strategic threat to international security to the entire middle east and to the state of israel gantz said and we will work closely with our american allies to ensure that any new agreement with iran will secure the vital interests of the world of the united states prevent a dangerous arms race in our region and protect the state of israel the israeli armys chief of staff lt gen aviv kochavi also appeared to reference iran the israeli militarys operations in the middle east are not hidden from the eyes of the enemy kochavi said they are watching us seeing our abilities and weighing their steps with caution multiple israeli media outlets reported sunday that a cyberattack caused the blackout in natanz public broadcaster kan said israel was likely behind the attack citing israels alleged responsibility for the stuxnet attacks a decade ago channel tv cited experts as estimating the attack shut down entire sections of the facility none of the reports included sources or explanations of how the outlets came to that assessment in tehran iranian officials meanwhile welcomed south korean prime minister chung syekyun the first visit by a premier from seoul since before the islamic revolution iran on friday released a south korean oil tanker held since january amid a dispute with seoul over billions of dollars of its assets frozen there due to sanctions on saturday iran announced it had launched a chain of centrifuges at the plant officials also began testing the centrifuge which they say will enrich uranium times faster than irans firstgeneration centrifuges the the nuclear deal limited iran to using only for enrichment since thenpresident donald trumps withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal in tehran has abandoned all the limits of its uranium stockpile it now enriches up to purity a technical step away from weaponsgrade levels of iran maintains its atomic program is for peaceful purposes on tuesday an iranian cargo ship said to serve as a floating base for irans paramilitary revolutionary guard forces off the coast of yemen was struck by an explosion likely from a limpet mine iran has blamed israel for the blast that attack escalated a longrunning shadow war in mideast waterways targeting shipping in the region ben zion

photography enthusiasts and held a canon professional camera the gap is too big my photos cant bear to look straight so thinking about going abroad next time i should also bring a professional camera picture italy nanyi amafi coast in it was just going to italy i started to buy that camera better after climbing for a long time i felt that if i often travel and have the opportunity to travel by myself the camera is lightweight so i decided to buy micro micro strip eye then panasonics online nickname first love girlfriend machine i think it is very fate because i am also going to buy a better camera for the first time it was only a few days after the out of the box at that time the had a relatively large disadvantage that is the color of the camera screen the gap between the brightness passed to the computer was a bit large but because it was compared with a fool camera that year it seemed that it was okay figure hualien qixingtan however the first love girlfriend was placed in the cabinet after returning to china and occasionally appeared in the appearance even when i went to hualien alone i did not bring her because i was carrying a backpack at the time and i arrived at hualien for three days i decisively i only brought my mobile phone as a result i saw a scene in one morning a beautiful scene that made me memorable for a long time the first thought of returning to god at the time was damn why dont i go out with a camera through the picture of the clouds it is only about the beauty shot by the mobile phone figure tokyo arakawa line the enlightenment of japan s travel in was a self release self and traveled alone abroad intersection i set off with my cousin and cousin on the same day but different flights two more days more than them and i found a lot of photos in the two days at that time i took a road tram on the flyover abroad in feidishan i took more than a hundred sheets and i chose the favorite one the tram stopped waiting for the red light pedestrians also had people who rode a bicycle crossing the road i really like the starting point of taking pictures figure tokyo takaiga mountain later i flew to osaka myself took the shinkansen to tokyo and then returned from tokyo to the journey from tokyo in late november i wanted to get lucky to see if i could enjoy the maple but the maple leaves have not turned red yet the maple leaves of the traffic light green yellow and red but in front of the shrine in takaje mountain i saw smoke surrounded by smoke and the sun was sprinkled through smoke i felt super dreamy i was still thinking when i took the camera those pictures come back and see uh its okay at least cigarettes and light have after that i started to study how the camera should be adjusted which allows me to take pictures i want to take in my mind i still think there is still a lot of room for progress therefore this series is called unprofessional photography log figure add a italian white cat it turns out that i

南義 阿瑪菲海岸2011\n2011年的時候，剛好要去義大利，我開始比較要購入那一種相機比較好，爬文了半天覺得如果以後常出遊，又有機會自己出遊，相機輕便還是很重要的，所以決定要購入微單眼，那時Panasonic 的GF1，網路暱稱初戀女朋友機，我覺得很有緣欸！因為我也是第一次要買比較好的相機，要是BF1的話就更貼切了，反正後來就帶著GF1到義大利了，其實現在看起來，覺得當初拍得實在也不算太好，畢竟新手上路，才開箱沒幾天就飛了，當時的BF1有一個比較大的缺點，就是相機螢幕的顏色，跟傳到電腦上的亮度差距有點大，讓我適應了很久才跟她生出點默契。\n不過當年因為是跟傻瓜相機做比較，所以覺得好像也還可以啦！\n\n圖二、花蓮 七星潭2013\n不過初戀女朋友，在回國之後就被放在櫃子裡，偶爾才出場亮相，連我獨自去花蓮旅行，都沒有帶上她，因為我當時背著一個背包，抵達花蓮三天行程全部單車+走路，我果斷的...只帶了手機，結果嘛，某日早晨看了一幕，一個美的令我久久難忘的一幕...當時回過神的第一個念頭是...靠！我為什麼不帶相機出門...\n那個光透過雲撒下來的畫面，手機拍出來的大概只有50%的美吧！\n\n圖三、東京 荒川線2014\n2014年的日本旅行，算是後來放飛自我，獨自在國外旅行的啟蒙吧？！我與表姊、表妹同天出發但不同班機，又比她們多待了二天，多的那兩天我找了許多點拍照，那時在飛鳥山公國外的天橋上拍路面電車，左拍右拍的，拍了百餘張，選了最喜歡的一張，電車剛好停下來等紅燈，行人們還有騎腳踏車的人過馬路，與電車同框的畫面，好像，這大概是我開始真的喜歡拍照的起點。\n\n圖三、東京 高尾山2016\n後來又是一次，自己飛到大阪，再搭新幹線到東京，再從東京飛回來的旅程，11月下旬，本來想碰運氣看能不能賞到楓，但楓葉還沒全轉紅，只賞到了紅綠燈的楓葉(有綠有黃有紅)，但在高尾山的神社前，看到煙霧繚繞，而陽光就透過煙霧撒下來，瞬間覺得超夢幻，拿相機起來拍時還在想，不知我拍不拍得出那畫面，回來一看，嗯！還行吧，至少煙跟光都有了。\n\n再之後我才開始研究相機該怎麼調整，能讓我拍出我腦海中想拍的畫面，到現在還是覺得還有非常多的進步的空間，所以，這個系列就叫不專業攝影日誌吧！\n\n圖五、追加一張義大利白貓 2011\n原來我幫貓咪拍寫真的症狀這麼久之前就有了…"",""device"":""Android"",""tags"":[""cn"",""wherein"",""steemexclusive"",""photography"",""travel"",""blog"",""cat""]}",2021-04-11T15:46:42+00:00,52798069,Taiwan

南義 阿瑪菲海岸2011\n2011年的時候，剛好要去義大利，我開始比較要購入那一種相機比較好，爬文了半天覺得如果以後常出遊，又有機會自己出遊，相機輕便還是很重要的，所以決定要購入微單眼，那時Panasonic 的GF1，網路暱稱初戀女朋友機，我覺得很有緣欸！因為我也是第一次要買比較好的相機，要是BF1的話就更貼切了，反正後來就帶著GF1到義大利了，其實現在看起來，覺得當初拍得實在也不算太好，畢竟新手上路，才開箱沒幾天就飛了，當時的BF1有一個比較大的缺點，就是相機螢幕的顏色，跟傳到電腦上的亮度差距有點大，讓我適應了很久才跟她生出點默契。\n不過當年因為是跟傻瓜相機做比較，所以覺得好像也還可以啦！\n\n圖二、花蓮 七星潭2013\n不過初戀女朋友，在回國之後就被放在櫃子裡，偶爾才出場亮相，連我獨自去花蓮旅行，都沒有帶上她，因為我當時背著一個背包，抵達花蓮三天行程全部單車+走路，我果斷的...只帶了手機，結果嘛，某日早晨看了一幕，一個美的令我久久難忘的一幕...當時回過神的第一個念頭是...靠！我為什麼不帶相機出門...\n那個光透過雲撒下來的畫面，手機拍出來的大概只有50%的美吧！\n\n圖三、東京 荒川線2014\n2014年的日本旅行，算是後來放飛自我，獨自在國外旅行的啟蒙吧？！我與表姊、表妹同天出發但不同班機，又比她們多待了二天，多的那兩天我找了許多點拍照，那時在飛鳥山公園外的天橋上,拍路面電車，左拍右拍的，拍了百餘張，選了最喜歡的一張，電車剛好停下來等紅燈，行人們還有騎腳踏車的人過馬路，與電車同框的畫面，這大概是我開始真的喜歡拍照的起點！\n\n圖三、東京 高尾山2016\n後來又是一次，自己飛到大阪，再搭新幹線到東京，再從東京飛回來的旅程，11月下旬，本來想碰運氣看能不能賞到楓，但楓葉還沒全轉紅，只賞到了紅綠燈的楓葉(有綠有黃有紅)，但在高尾山的神社前，看到煙霧繚繞，而陽光就透過煙霧撒下來，瞬間覺得超夢幻，拿相機起來拍時還在想，不知我拍不拍得出那畫面，回來一看，嗯！還行吧，至少煙跟光都有了。\n\n再之後我才開始研究相機該怎麼調整，能讓我拍出我腦海中想拍的畫面，到現在還是覺得還有非常多的進步的空間，所以，這個系列就叫不專業攝影日誌吧！\n\n圖五、追加一張義大利白貓 2011\n原來我幫貓咪拍寫真的症狀這麼久之前就有了…"",""device"":""Android"",""tags"":[""cn"",""wherein"",""steemexclusive"",""photography"",""travel"",""blog"",""cat""]}",2021-04-11T16:11:51+00:00,52798564,Taiwan

,hive-111825,ahmed1345,writing-and-reviews-the-story-of-north-korea-with-other-countries-denuclearisation,"WRITING AND REVIEWS: THE STORY OF NORTH KOREA WITH OTHER COUNTRIES,DENUCLEARISATION",the moon jaein regime insists that north korea has a will to denuclearize so it must be resolved through dialogue suddenly the biden administration insists that the korean peninsula should be denuclearized not north korea whether it is the denuclearization of north korea or the denuclearization of the korean peninsula both are far from the essence of the problem the reason north korea insisted on denuclearization of the korean peninsula is that the us with nuclear weapons was stationed on the korean peninsula of course its not just because the us military is stationed in korea north korea believes that the united states can intervene on the korean peninsula at any time as long as the united states has a military alliance with south korea it is insisting on the denuclearization of the korean peninsula because it believes that the us can use nuclear weapons at any time if it engages in military intervention on the korean peninsula in other words the denuclearization of the korean peninsula that north korea thinks ultimately means the state in which the united states cuts off military alliance relations with south korea from north koreas point of view the state that the us is guaranteed not to attack north korea on the basis of south korean protection is called the denuclearization of the korean peninsula on the other hand the denuclearization of the korean peninsula that south korea thinks is really naive it literally means that neither south korea nor north korea have nuclear weapons the problem is that such a state cannot exist this is because north korea considers that the case in which the united states cuts off military relations with south korea and there is no threat of using nuclear weapons by foreign forces is denuclearization of the korean peninsula in this regard north korea will claim its nuclear weapons as a guarantee for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula the reason why the biden administration is advocating for the denuclearization of north korea rather than the denuclearization of the korean peninsula means that north korea must be denuclearized the problem is that it is not possible to denuclearize north korea in any way or case by possessing nuclear weapons north korea is free from any outside interference in addition as time goes by an environment that is more favorable to north korea is being created as the competition for hegemony between the us and china intensifies the ransom price of north korea is rising more and more when the united states and china partnered with each other the united states attempted to denuclearize north korea on condition that it was under chinese influence in other words the united states thought that it would be advantageous if only north koreas nuclear weapons were eliminated as a condition of making north korea tibet north korea has blocked all attempts by china to overthrow the kim jongun regime it seems that almost all of the forces that could become chinas insiders have been purged most of the internal purges that took place after kim jongun seized power should be seen as removing a faction that could be influenced by china the representative person is jang seongtaek of course i think kim jongnam also killed him as the united states and china compete for supremacy north korea has become a very valuable entity from the chinese standpoint if the us takes over north korea china is in a very serious situation if you think that all of north koreas nuclear weapons are headed towards china you can fully predict how serious the situation is the united states has blown up all those opportunities the united states hasnt figured out exactly whats most important you may have thought that it would be possible to deploy nuclear weapons targeting china in south korea and japan it is impossible to deploy us nuclear weapons in japan and south korea it is difficult for any regime to survive the judgment of the people the only way the united states can deploy nuclear weapons in japan and south korea is to have nuclear weapons from japan and south korea apart from south korea what would happen if japan had a nuclear power japan with nuclear weapons will never be japan after world war ii as the united states knew it in that case japan is much more likely to return to japan immediately before world war ii rather it was much more advantageous to turn north korea on its own side in this way the denuclearization of the korean peninsula or the denuclearization of north korea is nothing but an investigation the essence of the problem lies elsewhere the united states did not look at the moon but only looked at a finger and dragged this situation south korea didnt think about what was in its interests and it just came to this day in this situation north korea is the only one to calmly grasp the situation since north korea cannot entrust its fate to others it is a cold and accurate assessment of the situation in any case the regime after moon jaein must think carefully about what to do and what to do,{},"{""profile"":{""name"":""Ahmed Adam"",""about"":""I am a chelsea fun i love to blog ,support people etc"",""location"":""Navrongo

april she discusses the history of the idea beginning with the description of higherdimension geometry in then moving on to researchers in the early and centuries she points out that einsteins work gave us dimensions of space plus a fourth dimension for time other researchers found that by adding additional dimensions they could account for electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces this realm of theory is known as and it predicts dimensions split as follows gravity time electromagnetic force weak nuclear force strong nuclear force although this has never been confirmed experimentally and it leads to some computational challenges in certain areas of physics it is consistent with the maximum number of dimensions that are needed for part ii here is the video i discussed xenobots in my post last week life as a geometry problem are these the first manmade living organisms in short these are tiny microorganisms that are constructed from frog cells but designed to be capable of locomotion by an evolutionary algorithm in a supercomputer heres more about them from science writer this article is reporting on research that was published in science robotics on march summarizing the impact of the research ball saysthe xenobots are turning some conventional views in developmental biology upside down they suggest that the frog genome doesnt uniquely instruct cells about how to proliferate differentiate and arrange themselves into a frog body rather thats just one possible outcome of the process that the genomic programming permits andthe results seem to imply that individual cells have a kind of decisionmaking capacity that creates a palette of possible bodies they could build constrained and guided by the genome but not defined by itaccording to ball evolutionary biologist suggests that these xenobots represent a totally new type of creature that is defined by what it does instead of its biological and evolutionary history this is extended by who says that the xenobot experiments open a whole new window to interrogate development and more generally novel forms of complex life key points from this article are that xenobots are built out of frog cells but they are radically different from frogs the cells demonstrate a sort of decisionmaking process while selfassembling cells communicate with each other electronically without using nerve cells as intermediaries the cells are driven by an inate desire to survive in general the article notes that xenobots normally live for about a week but with careful nutrition management they can survive for as long as days boston dynamics atlas robot is famous for its dancing and other agility but these abilities are highly choreographed having a biped robot move and balance without this laborintensive choreography is still a difficult goal to that end berkeleys cassie represents a step forward cassie has used reinforcement learning to be able to do things like walk in a crouch and

nature according to adamczyk one of the biggest challenges to this line of business is the firms reputation as a thermostat company however he expects their quantum computer to begin generating revenue this year and become profitable in a few years according to their recent publication honeywells quantum compute offering is more powerful than products from traditional firms like ibm and google this article amplifies that point sayinghoneywells computer has a quantum volume of a metric that factors in the number of qubits and the complexity of the problem that the supercomputer must solve thats double the amount the nearest competitor has disclosed publicly and honeywell expects that to grow tenfold each year for the next five years well beyond the pace at which others are

,hive-119812,rosevillariasa,new-contest-movie-time-or-or-life-of-pi,New Contest!! Movie Time! || Life of Pi,hello friends i hope youre doing all great today greetings from the philippines i am delighted to have come across another great contest in this wonderful community of steem geography initiated by our good friend belenguerra worldgeography as always this community has been a constant inspiration to write to share about the earth about the things unique to each and every country our culture and traditions and today for our weeks contest i am also excited to share about this movie which i consider as one of my favorites its called life of pi image life of pi is based on yann martels novel and directed by ang lee it is a story of a young man who survives a shipwreck and months in a lifeboat with a large bengal tiger named richard parker pis family owns and runs a zoo in their hometown in india when he is a teenager his family decides to sell the animals and immigrate to canada on a cargo ship a terrible storm occurs during the voyage the next morning he finds himself in the company of a zebra a hyena and an orangutan named orange juice hiding out of sight beneath the canvas of the lifeboat is the tiger richard parker the hyena wounds and eats the zebra then goes after orange juice the orangutan puts up a good fight but the hyena ultimately kills her richard parker finally makes himself known by killing and eating the hyena now only pi and richard parker survive on the lifeboat image how pi and richard parker survive in the pacific ocean makes up the rest of the movie pi was able to find ways how to feed himself and the tiger using the provisions stored in the lifeboat inventing ways to catch fish and store water to drink he considers a variety of survival options and concludes that he must tame the tiger although he is unable to fully train and domesticate richard parker by blowing a whistle and rocking the lifeboat enough to make the tiger seasick pi is able to subdue him and secure his own territory on the lifeboat richard parker and pi eventually find an island which is made entirely of trees roots leaves fresh water and plants however pi makes a horrible discovery that causes them to leave the island believing he has found a fruitbearing tree pi peels back the layers of a piece of fruit to find that it contains a human tooth the island is a carnivorous being consuming everything that lives on it pi and richard parker return to the lifeboat and the ocean image as time passes floating adrift finally pi and richard parker arrived in the shores of mexico both of them are too weak to move but then richard parker slowly takes his steps away from pi and runs into the wild and is never seen again pi cried loudly as he was abandoned by richard parker which he considered his friend pi was rescued by the village people image what hits me the most is pis famous line when richard parker the bengal tiger just left him without saying goodbye i suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go but what always hurts the mostis not taking a moment to say goodbye if you are richard parker will you have the guts to say goodbye or will you just leave just like how richard parker left pi leaving without saying goodbye image this movie is about choosing to believe in the impossible in choosing to fight than to give up in choosing to have faith and keep it and most importantly to reflect and believe in god in all our circumstances god is always our safe harbor our refuge from the storm and our island of salvation thats it for now my friends thanks for dropping by always rose

,news,sasageyonews,iran-says-key-natanz-nuclear-facility-hit-by-sabotage,Iran says key Natanz nuclear facility hit by 'sabotage',a nuclear facility in iran was hit by sabotage a day after it unveiled new uranium enrichment equipment the countrys top nuclear official says ali akbar salehi did not say who was to blame for the terrorist act which caused a power failure at the natanz complex south of tehran on sunday israeli public media however cited intelligence sources who said it was the result of an israeli cyberattack israel has not commented on the incident directly but in recent days it has ramped up its warnings about irans nuclear programme the latest incident comes as diplomatic efforts to revive a nuclear deal abandoned by the us under the trump administration in have resumed why irans nuclear facilities are still vulnerable to attack why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter irans nuclear crisis in words on saturday irans president hassan rouhani inaugurated new centrifuges at the natanz site in a ceremony that was broadcast live on television centrifuges are devices needed to produce enriched uranium which can be used to make reactor fuel as well as nuclear weapons it represented another breach of the countrys undertakings in the deal which only permits iran to produce and store limited quantities of enriched uranium to be used to produce fuel for commercial power plants what has iran said on sunday a spokesman for the atomic energy organisation of iran aeoi behrouz kamalvandi said an incident had occurred in the morning involving the nuclear facilitys power network mr kamalvandi did not provide further details but told irans fars news agency there there had been no casualties or leaks later state tv read out a statement by aeoi head ali akbar salehi in which he described the incident as sabotage and nuclear terrorism condemning this despicable move the islamic republic of iran emphasises the need for the international community and the international atomic energy agency to deal with this nuclear terrorism he was quoted as saying iran reserves the right to take action against the perpetrators he added the iaea said it was aware of the reports of an incident but would not comment last july sabotage was blamed for a fire at the natanz site which hit a central centrifuge assembly workshop iran nuclear crisis the basics world powers dont trust iran some countries believe iran wants nuclear power because it wants to build a nuclear bomb it denies this so a deal was struck in iran and six other countries reached a major agreement iran would stop some nuclear work in return for an end to harsh penalties or sanctions hurting its economy what is the problem now iran restarted banned nuclear work after former us president donald trump pulled out of the deal and reimposed sanctions on iran even though new leader joe biden wants to rejoin both sides say the other must make the first move how could israel be involved israeli public broadcaster kan citing unnamed intelligence sources said the apparent power cut at the facility was caused by an israeli cyber operation the haaretz newspaper also said the incident could be assumed to be an israeli cyberattack ron benyishai a defence analyst at the ynet news website said that with iran progressing towards nuclear weapons capability it was reasonable to assume that the problem might not have been caused by an accident but by deliberate sabotage intended to slow the nuclear race accelerated by the negotiations with the us on removing sanctions later on sunday israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the struggle against iran and its proxies and the iranian armament efforts is a huge mission the situation that exists today will not necessarily be the situation that will exist tomorrow he added without referencing the iran incident directly the iranian nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa has been in intensive care since donald trump pulled the us out of it under the biden administration diplomatic efforts have been redoubled to revive it but mr netanyahu has warned against a return to the deal and declared last week that israel would not be bound by a new agreement with tehran what happened to the deal the nuclear deal only allows iran to produce and store limited quantities of uranium enriched up to concentration uranium enriched to or more can be used to make nuclear weapons mr trump said the accord was based on a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy programme and reinstated crippling economic sanctions in an attempt to compel iran to negotiate a replacement iran which insists it does not want nuclear weapons refused to do so and retaliated by rolling back a number of key commitments under the accord it has since accelerated the breaches in an attempt to increase pressure on the us they have included operating advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium resuming enrichment to concentration of the most fissile isotope and building a stockpile of that material the end of the trump era has caused a collective but cautious sigh of relief in iran some in the gulf region feared that in the dying days of his presidency donald trump might choose to double down on his policy of maximum pressure on iran and launch a military strike on its civilian nuclear plants and other targets reports from washington in november indicated this was one option the us president had looked at before being talked out of it by his advisers by contrast presidentelect joe biden has made it clear that he wants the us to rejoin the nuclear pact with iran which would mean reversing sanctions and releasing money to tehran in exchange for irans full compliance so is iran now safe from attack in a word no israel remains extremely concerned not just by irans civilian nuclear activities but by its prolific programme to develop its arsenal of ballistic missiles on thursday israels defence minister benny gantz was quoted as saying in reference to irans nuclear development programme it is clear that israel needs to have a military option on the table it requires resources and investment and i am working to make that happen israel as the islamic republics declared enemy sees a nuclear bomb in iranian hands as a threat to its very existence and has urged the world to stop it before it is too late iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely peaceful but its recent action to increase the enrichment of its uranium one of a sequence which contravene the deal has set alarm bells ringing in israel suspected that iraqi president saddam hussein was looking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability in operation babylon it took preemptive action by carrying out a successful air raid using its own and jets destroying iraqs osirak nuclear reactor twentysix years later in it did the same to syria in operation outside the box destroying a secret plutonium reactor in the desert near deir alzour just before it was

,stimcity,zenzen25,5eaump,"[길 위의 술] 위스키 라이프의 시작, 오사카 산토리 위스키 하우스", whiskey was a tasteless drink for me beer sake jeans vodka traditional liquor by country i like and drink almost all kinds of alcohol but the only whiskey was outside alcohol thats because i first encountered whiskey many people dont know but india is the largest consumer country of whiskey i was in the first place that india was the first to consume whiskey but it was convinced to combine the history of the british colony and billion people in fact my friends who met while traveling to india and their friends in india also enjoyed whiskey instead their drink is not whiskey made in the united states or scotland but a cheap whiskey made in india after listening to this story india is fully convinced of the reason why whiskey is the largest consumer of whiskey in india the production is as high as consumption according to a research in the uk indian whiskey accounts for seven of the worlds top tents in officers choice mcdowell royal stag etc are included in it its a familiar name for me perhaps my first whiskey was mcdowell or royal stag you can buy a bottle of for less than won so you dont have to say how much the quality of whiskey is i had been drinking whiskey for a few years in india called whiskey so i couldnt like whiskey in may when i quit my company and worked as a freelancer i visited osaka where my best friend p lives with a friend h the criteria for judging whether or not a drinker are simpler than you think do you have to drink or not there are quite a few classes that eat well and play well when drinking but rarely mix they like the energy and exciting atmosphere that several people drink and make not like alcohol itself the first condition of the drinker is mixed all three of us were drinkers who enjoyed mixing so of course our trips were focused on alcohol mino brewery santori beer factory and yamazaki distillery were included in our travel list whiskey didnt really like it but when the japanese whiskey boom was then at that time i was trying to go to the yamazaki distillery when i was really curious about the whiskey but i couldnt finish the reservation the small scale local beer and the huge beer factory operated by large corporations were very different from the size the type of beer and the atmosphere of the beer but they could not erase the curiosity of japanese whiskey thats why i found out to find a japanese whiskey and found osaka santori whiskey house the santori whiskey house consists of three zones whiskey gallery and dining restaurant wwww whiskey bottle bar it is a place that aims to melt in life through various experiences of whiskeys unique charm taste and joy and to create creative development of whiskey culture located in osaka building in umeda umeda osaka santori wisky house is more appropriate than museum than house the gallery from the entrance is to see the history of the santory at a glance by exhibiting old whiskeys in the early days of santori as well as colorful whiskey stocks as well as oak barrels and rare whiskeys released so far and past posters and trophies the yamazaki distillery was founded in so it is interesting to see as it is years old in addition it has whiskey for to years before entering the restaurant but now there is an interior goods store that sells various tables chairs pens fans and coasters made by dismantling retired oak barrels at that time i didnt have much interest but i regret that i dont buy anything now how important oak barrels are and that oak barrels are determining whiskeys quality gallery and interior goods are not big but its fun to look at it the restaurant itself is not very special we set the beer tab and divided the beer tab and divided into a table seat where you can enjoy food and alcohol the name of the dining is wwww po double you which is named after water woods wind and whisky in order to make a delicious whiskey water wind and trees are important but from its name i remembered drinking whiskey under the trees that were shaken by the wind where the clear water flowed i like alcohol but it was highball that three outside people chose at the same time santori is a company that developed kakubin a highball only manner they drank cheetah high ball hakushu high ball and hibiki high ball it was different from the sweet and sweet high ball i ate at a local japanese restaurant the beautiful and refreshing glass cups made with ice the high ball fluttering with ice was not sweet and refreshing and the taste was quite good naturally i first knew that if i had a good alcohol highball could be so delicious the food was also great the plates to taste sweet potatoes and various snacks at once seemed to be plain but they were carefully concerned with alcohol we had a pleasant time with cheers that it was delicious a few days later we visited santori whiskey house a few days later i wanted to treat delicious drinks and food on p which led a pleasant drinking tour with water after eating high balls with katsudo and various tempura he challenged the whiskey tasting tour santori whiskey house has a japanese whiskey and a world whiskey tasting tour for five glasses of alcohol santori is a japanese company and i wondered why i sell whiskey from the us ireland or scotland but it turned out that it was related to the strategy that santori had merged with various companies for many years in addition to the british whiskey morrison bomor the companys largest whiskey company jim beam has changed its name to santoris distillation business and has changed its name to the beam santory group and became the worlds third main company as we were curious about japans whiskey we ordered the japanese whiskey tour the glank caranzan contains five kinds of whiskey made in santori including kaku yamazaki hibiki cheetah and hakyu we each took a glass of gulp uh reading when i ate whiskey in india i always mixed water mixed ice or mixed hot water in scotland a small amount of water is mixed to increase the taste and flavor of whiskey but indian whiskey was reasonable to mix water to cover the quality so this was the first time i had eaten whiskey with no mixing anything and the appreciation was just strong i slowly wet one by one savor the taste and distinguish the difference and write down how it tastes in the note i havent eaten the solo so much so i prefer to have a good neck honestly whiskey was not delicious however with the attempt to distinguish the taste by eating five tasting sets i became interested in whiskey and the whiskey experience continued to expand as i accumulated these experiences the value of suntory whiskey house which suggests that the charm taste and joy of whiskey is suggested to melt into life through various experiences is effective for me and now whiskey has become my favorite alcohol,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNpNBnQzGdv6CWMbvEA9VHJJEraBXWNaEbkMhWqn7rWZF/KakaoTalk_20180819_015214915.jpg"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT3KTjr5FjjmSjomkhhjhEpnvYgv7BaUcb5srinfUcjNy/_DSC4042.JPG""}}","{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNpNBnQzGdv6CWMbvEA9VHJJEraBXWNaEbkMhWqn7rWZF/KakaoTalk_20180819_015214915.jpg"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmT3KTjr5FjjmSjomkhhjhEpnvYgv7BaUcb5srinfUcjNy/_DSC4042.JPG""}}","{""tags"":[""stimcity"",""whisky"",""osaka"",""travel"",""kr-pen""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZzy3Pj1FffQMBEjAfsYi7K86eDrXN2Xj7GSTLmW7KBRE/_DSC4521.jfif"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQxECfkLC1EhjL8j8P9ssfwxQiY5CWDkb9icVjTvRy93i/_DSC4522.jfif"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmZ7yhx6wVV6SiFAcroDZk58o4BiexYqtDk4rk16B6V518/_DSC4529.jfif"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmYTrh9T5HHgGxVwpVxp43XAA6ycApHHCXLvjaVW6NpBGc/_DSC4519.jfif"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfDB1QEC1HGnivVRwEPCjTpmv72Z2H8E4v4L4JZ3vZXuM/KakaoTalk_20210412_103556446.jpg""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-12T08:48:12+00:00,52818309,

7u7 @IsaacRomero,i already arrived on writing monday and the whole community knows guys promised is debt so here i bring you the second part of my story i wanted to make a short story of three parts but thinking i was seeing later in history and my creativity says follow continue and if you say that is because it is good i thank psicoparades samuelmarcano and venezonalos for the support they give me i know they are pending my stories and i give them thank you i cant forget to mention the children of the telegram group are many but thank you i love you very much without further ado i still try to contain and write little but it is that the emotion of the scenes catches me cover made by me in adobe photoshop cc part two i was still sitting on the couch staring at the palm leaf it was something crazy and unusual i was shining i kept doing it and my uncle was still telling things about the years that came out of adventure around the world to sometimes i the extinction of a kind of medicinal plant were incredible adventures although i know that there is something that hides me and when i was about to say something without mentioning that they look for your father to kill us ups i shouldnt have to say that says my uncle max jokingly although the last did not sound joke its already uncle who are looking for them to kill them well do you remember that i told you about that strange tribe that also had a connection with the palm tree if i had told me but i didnt pay much attention ifif i remember i know not i will tell you again there are two tribes apart from the two families that have connection with the palm tree a lurius are a pacifist tribe that are in the amazon and other parts of the world but mostly in this place they although they seek peace are the tribe with very advanced combat characteristics since when the colonizers arrived to the new earth came the rest of the world there this tribe became very famous for learning the combat measures of other regions very easy many celebrities who know are lurius who do not confuse your appearance usually mix with the other very easy families you i say so that sounded a bit strange to be true wait how i ask without thinking it is very interesting that my uncle knows a lot about this tribe well the lurius are very close to the family so much that they insisted that we stay with them so it was for a while but the village that kept a darwin was attacked by the other tribe the darkwiz how curious it sounds like the darwin it is not coincidence they are the enemies of the family their tribe was founded to make us against they appeared after the druid what if i know is that if you see someone dressed in black with a red accessory even if it is a clock a necklace some shoes to the socks that is your enemy one more thing these do not fight like the lurius then they are more modern they use latest technology weapons i dont know how they get it but the last thing they were working with the japanese mafia to obtain electromagnetic pulse weapons it was something incredible it was not only an enemy of my own blood but there is also a tribe of people who want to end with me and now they are crazy geeks lovers of japanese culture my life is complicated in that my uncle finishes that we have to leave as soon as possible i will dedicate a year to train martial arts and then we will move looking for my fathers clues where the island could be if we find it we can make sure that the magical palm still there is and our family purpose would continue standing i know that my father still lives i dont know where he is but i still have the hope that he is there in that when i finally stopped admiring the glowing leaf of harry potter i get ready to look for my backpack but where is my backpack i say between teeth i remember throwing it on the street to surprise my uncle poda joke when we have been talking and my bag is outside if i go adventure all my things will help me as soon as i look out the window i notice that there are hit trucks down the street they are parked around the house somewhat creepy in that i also see my backpack next to one of the trucks and to top it up that same car opens its doors the at the same time very precise in the act the others do the same as waiting for the initial movement to do from the first truck a man with black suit and dark glasses with a red arc comes out very great to be something from another decade the first man approaches and takes my backpack without opening it makes a spontaneous movement with his head and stare at my uncles house not only that but the window where i was it was impossible for me to recognize me was in a gossip neighboring mode behind the curtains but i still felt the feeling i had seen me as soon as i separate a little from the window i notice that he makes a movement with his hand raises his arm and clenching his fist strongly makes a signal towards him to my uncles house i did not know what to think about that i remembered the tribes all the men who left the vehicle came with black clothes some were normal jeans other striped shirt one had even black shores which by the way they were great because they had strawberry drawings but thats not the point the case is that they came to where i towards the house tito i think we will have visits and are not explorers selling cookies in that my uncle leaves the kitchen with a suit that looks like that of the old adventure films but better he had military like jeans and a bulletproof vest hopper see me downward i did not understand what he was referring to until in an instant i began to listen was gone where is it had he made a bullet when i notice from the floor my uncle runs around the room to the wall of the main door it seems to fly dodged the bullets as an art of magic and they will not grow it to me guess they have in hand if gentlemen a grenades spear of those that come out in the transformers movie yes those then i show you the trick of how to use your eyes to see things that are not plants with a smile on his face i gyped my eye it seems happy not like me i was about to urinate me or i was and with the fear i didnt notice now they eat a little of this at a brief moment it turns the window where a couple of grenades releases two vehicles that were in charge of the house from the floor i notice that those great cars fly through the air i wanted one i say whispening do you want one of these i will give it to you for your birthday for now stop and go out the door that is in the kitchen and go to the house that is behind my uncle was still launching grenades apparently while he looked out the shots the manadarwin murderers think of their lives too i thought they were finishing in that i drag me little by little as a military my uncle against the wall again sees me crawling so you will arrive tomorrow move shouts at me with the sound of the bullets pass the window and their screams it seems that their words were said by the angels in that i get up and many bullets pass through the whole house my uncle to see that i get looked and throw more grenades in that the deadly weapon is stuck and more bullets pass i notice how they pass by my side i feel the rose of one by my side nothing serious i thought at first it felt cold then i burned i leave the house quickly and i see the house in that my uncle jumps through the window of the kitchen breaking the glass sorry i wanted a little more emotion i dont know if you understand me go to the vehicle i have to prepare the fuel im walking something agitated i think the wound begins to hurt great i dont think i die here and now i pass for the house and see as a kind of a cabin and jet dont tell me ill get on that go up fast my uncle shouts me said i was fixing the fuel but i dont think i have time to wait for it hot and then escape i did not pay attention to him and somehow i got up my side hurt a lot izquierdo where the bullet had been touched had my hand there for a while when i notice that he has a red liquid dont tell me that this is my blood i say whispering my sight clouds a little try to be awake as much as possible my uncle arrives immediately he climbs as if nothing to the front seat it was a military type jet cabin so he only has two seats i was a little stunned i dont think my uncle states so much uncle i feel a little i say a little tired something sore im losing blood it was just a rose as it may be that this is happening to me quiet hopper im too excited that is not uncle is that this yes i know youve never flown before but this will be fast when i realize the cabin and as if it were a spring it drags us back and in the blink of an eye throws us through the air coming out a window of the house when we are in the air the cabin takes out a few wings underneath and a kind of motor begins to sound but it was not a propeller engine but of a propeller i dont know if it was true but i felt it was a rocket in the back we were already in the air but i couldnt enjoy it i was dying the function does not end time for my fuel to do your job when i realize my uncle makes a species and pirouette in the air to be able to see the floor in that a column of fire was on the house where men had passed hehehe im still dangerous for them thats why they didnt attacked me when they first saw me in the window they wouldnt do it from those you see that i throw my vehicle with a kamikaze vest a great story was heard but i could not be aware of it i put my hand on the wound but i knew that it would not stop bleeding i noticed a tape on the floor i take it i take off my shirt and put it in the wound by pressure with the tape this will help me i said i felt that i was fainted all you can say was uncle im losing a lot of san gre much what i listen to my uncles voice further and further his questions his concern i feel that we are descending very hurriedly i dont think its so stupid as to throw us against the floor hey everything will be fine those were the last words i remember when i was above the improvised airplane i dont remember much just blurred things a hospital room a hall i think he had survived he is lucky although it was only a rose the adrenaline of his bleeding i listen to a doctor to speak while two more people take me to a room everything will be very small they will take care of you i listen to a familiar voice it was my uncle max those were what i remember before fainting again when i awake i find myself in a white room i had no windows in sight only one door an led tv a table to write but what i did not like was the color of the room something very annoying for my liking i prefer a light brown room i said between teeth the same said says a person who is apparently sitting next to me was not my uncle he wasnt a doctor either even if it looked like an old man lord i could tell me where i am where my uncle is and what i do here he doesnt tell me anything he just releases a small laugh with each other his facial features make me known i have seen them somewhere i see that your mother doesnt show you any photo of me well if i leave to go with that boy i dont think i missed me lord with all due respect i do not like to speak of my mother he does not know who he is i respond annoying he would speak as if my mother had made a very big mistake in that the lord gets up resting on his cane walked towards the only door in this place you should have a little more respect since i am your grandfather jacob mendel wait are you my grandfather the man claims to be my grandfather stops just before reaching the door he does not turn his head to the side as a way of saying i will not return to me but i will answer you this is do you have something to tell me i cant be standing all day where is my father of all the things of the world and you are going to ask that you are equal to him when i brought it i just ask if the island had already achieved you go straight to the point this conversation is already terminated i was going to ask him many more but it was noticeable that he would not answer them he went out the door as if he wouldnt come back anymore it was something strange this place he only has a door a led tv wait my backpack my backpack was on top of the night table next to my bed but how do i get here could it be that my grandfather commands those guys to eliminate us or was it coincidence that he was in that house i had many questions but if i knew something that my father had been here and i know he is alive one day i will find it i will not lose hope i have changed the name of the story because here you can better appreciate the essence of history for me it is fine i want to apologize for this inconvenience the story follows the same course and i want to tell you that thanks for your support everyone to the whole community the entire platform and everyone who is not yet part of it but they go on to read thanks share if you liked leave your voteup i would appreciate it this is venezuela for the world c sumon,"{""profile"":{""name"":""M4xRomero"",""about"":""Stories //

,hive-180932,aaronli,2hfqwx,稅季結束，痛苦事情要來了,the annual tax season is just over for a company responsible for finance it is the beginning of pain a previous article mentioned that i took over the companys finances in the middle because the one who was responsible for finance was too much to collapse and then i took over originally i never liked accounting or even resisted when i worked i would never contact the accounting piece and i never read it when i was reading but now the company is its own because everyones field is different in the current combination i honestly say that it is the most suitable candidate as a result after hiding for so many years i will finally face this piece its okay not to do it i want to do a little better as soon as i do what i want to do is to record the daily in and out of the flowing account and collecting good documents but by the way i can make a report that can see the companys status at this time i am still naive i bought a book about bookkeeping on the internet and then i first met the concepts of the accounts of accounts for the first time in fact even debit and credit account have been known for the first time therefore in the early days i kept entering the previous record of the previous old account looking for related receipts and at the same time i entered the new account every day on the other hand i kept learning about the new bookkeeping knowledge and i kept discovering my previous understanding before understanding the wrong place then constantly changing the previous record and then recovering the receipt that i didnt see before and the disappeared one would get a new one at the same time because i had a deep understanding of accounting the result of the model from opening order to record has also been changed once becoming more in line with accounting standards these processes really took several months before and after and now there are actually some in out accounts that still do not know how to deal with it which category should be attributed and because we have two stores but the owners of the two stores are slightly different the account as account and store b of natural store a should be separated so in fact i am making two stores but the two stores in fact it is the same company so it is to hardly disassemble a plate into two sets the complexity of among them really makes me a novice well the tax season is over although the nuclear division said that it would be paid before july they had enough time nuclear numbers but we also decided to pay it now because i dont know how to deal with it if you cant find the basis for the form you cant even find the source it is better to give the nuclear division earlier let him tell us what to deal with however although this process is painful it also makes me learn a lot at least i know how to understand whether a company is really making money or losing money which part of the company has a large expenditure which part of the income is too little etc this can not only help me go to operate better and the resources are better distributed in the stock it also allows me to do it for a listed company making money has a deeper understanding in fact the whole result is also good i really know the accounting of accounting i really know if the company is really healthy and i also know that the accounts really have to sort out every day otherwise they will gg people you need to face some challenges or pain in order to grow ,"{""profile"":{""name"":""Aaron Li"",""location"":""likerid:luenlun"",""cover_image"":""https://steemitimages.com/p/21PRtjKRXPQybj4WUXScWv5QPLninWRxfbcWNsx7SenD7Fp7Tt2nx1JKzuCT5uEQ9zMqeVJ5iMe3t8r2xoSNz6Xav5RtfSxity66gHMiFmGRuDjC9uButfcbBTa9MFXS3SmPyfWt4NB1CEZKxxwyiFx?format=match&mode=fit"",""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTNTVnssLBCj88LZEs7mHB3vP36pPgNZJnEdberKpaZTQ/5uld36.jpg""}}","{""profile"":{""website"":""http://www.steemzzang.com"",""cover_image"":""https://steemitimages.com/p/21PRtjKRXPQybj4WUXScWv5QPLninWRxfbcWNsx7SenD7Fp7Tt2nx1JKzuCT5uEQ9zMqeVJ5iMe3t8r2xoSNz6Xav5RtfSxity66gHMiFmGRuDjC9uButfcbBTa9MFXS3SmPyfWt4NB1CEZKxxwyiFx?format=match&mode=fit"",""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmTNTVnssLBCj88LZEs7mHB3vP36pPgNZJnEdberKpaZTQ/5uld36.jpg"",""location"":""Hong Kong"",""name"":""Aaron Li"",""dtube_pub"":""fwdRNFxH9dPpj7gTE1z282oEdsTqYqzQ7S6ftqtVTsK5""}}","{""tags"":[""cn"",""hk"",""palnet"",""blog"",""account"",""work"",""life"",""whalepower"",""zzan"",""dblog"",""diamondtoken"",""marlians"",""upfundme"",""actnearn""],""image"":[""https://images.hive.blog/DQmSsg41hVa32kXjkKn7RLTGawgRLb9XzqQmw4Dk5wRjXoN/image.png""],""app"":""steemcn/0.1"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-12T10:21:36+00:00,52820159,"Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong, China"

so if you didnt catch the last couple of posts were currently on a journey in fukuoka that we went on back in may neither of us had ever been to that part of japan before and since there were some cheap flights we decided to go explore a new region together here we go we continued our daylong journey through huis ten bosch a dutch towninspired theme park by renting a very unique tandem bike and taking a nice relaxing stroll through the rose garden it was truly a wonder going through such a nice and tranquil place i think everyone else that was there wanted to preserve the peace as well so it was quite quiet despite there being other tourists may saturday last week we left off on this picture of sean on the tandem bike i bet if you were just looking at this picture on its own you wouldnt know this was in japan and even more so with this picture i think they really did a great job recreating the look of a danish town from the cobblestone paths to the europeanstyle architecture it really felt like we were in a whole other country there was even this very elaboratelydesigned building that resembled a church im not sure what this was in reference to but i imagine it probably resembles another building in netherlands but there was a very pretty flower clock in front as well it reminded me of the flower clock item you can build in animal crossing new leaf and i did actually build it in my town back when i was still playing that game walking on from this churchlooking building we came up to an actual danishlooking town it felt like we traveled back in time too with that old carousel in the background there were these huge clogs lying around on the floor so you know what we had to do photo time i think people were staring at me trying to get into these humongous clogs but you know whatever after a couple more goofy shots we walked on and came to a wharf with an impressive looking arch but seeing this amount of stagnant water did make me paranoid of mosquitos breeding and it did kinda smell a little bit i think this area was the only area with a bad smell but walking away we found a whole harbour here with a ton of boats im not sure if these boats are even functional but they looked really cool and nicely lined up like this we didnt stick around too long because of the stench of stale dirty seawater so we walked on and got to this coollooking alleyway it was so nice and peaceful to just take a strollride in this tranquillooking place i think we were on the tandem bike still there was even a boat slowly cruising through the lake there barely breaking the surface of the water we walk along and end up on another side of the ferris wheel that we saw in the rose garden im not sure exactly what building this is but i think its the other side of that alleyway we ended up in this open area with food trucks and a whole lot of cafe tables and chairs there were a bunch of buildings surrounding the cafe area including this music hall and this oldstyle theater the sun was slowly setting already at it was still bright out but the weather was getting cooler at least not too far from this open area was a gundam and what looked to be a converted shipping container full of gundam stuff im not familiar with gundam but i imagine its pretty cool for those who are gundam fanatics and there must be quite a group of them in japan since there are whole gundam stores here and every bic camera sells gundam model sets not too far from the oldstyle theater was this other area of shops and cafes and this very europeanstyle fountain it reminds me a little of the famous trevi fountain in rome but obviously more brown and less grand still nice though and with the overhead lights i bet this place would look awesome at night we ended up back here in front of the chocolate factory that we saw when we first arrived and since there wasnt a queue now we decided to head in and check it out i really loved roald dahls charlie and the chocolate factory so i had high expectations for this place i mean i knew it wasnt an actual chocolate factory but just a chocolatethemed wonderland but man they really nailed it with the chocolate interior it wasnt actually made of chocolate but it sure did look like it it also had the look of a mansion for some reason im not sure what the signboard says unfortunately but i imagine theres some rich backstory to this chocolate mansion and it has something to do with this moustache man there was also this oldtimey photo studio where i think you could dress up in costumes and take photos here was the map that was entirely in japanese so i couldnt understand it they also had these interactive screens similar to the ones we saw in the cameras werent too accurate here but it was still fun nonetheless there was also a choco laboratory which i guess is a place where you could make your own chocolate there was this entire wall of flavours you could choose from and seating areas for you to makeeat your chocolate it did smell like chocolate here but i think it smelled a little fake like it wasnt fresh or something sorry for the blur btw there was also a chocolatethemed ball pit for parents to dump their kids in the cushioned that looked like chocolates and donuts were definitely something i could see myself buying next time though there was this wall of chocolate too im not sure if this was interactive though another interactive screen in this one you could move the flow of chocolate with your hand by swiping across it was pretty cool actually and of course at the end we wound up in the gift shop which had a whole slew of actual chocolate to buy there was also a frozen yogurt store beside it and after seeing so much chocolate we couldnt resist they had so many different flavours too there was some colourful umbrella decorations outside so we decided to take our yogurt outside to enjoy the view it was nice and cool outside now that the sun was setting perfect for dining al fresco unfortunately the yogurt wasnt very good and we ended up having to use the bathroom i hoped it wasnt because of the yogurt though but it did make my tummy churn a little iirc the bathroom itself was decorated with umbrellas too after a while the umbrellas lit up too it looked so pretty and with that i think thatll be it for now tune in next time for more adventures in huis ten bosch because were only about halfway through this day if you can believe it thanks so much for reading to find out more about me check out my intro post here check out my previous post in

so if you didnt catch the last couple of posts were currently on a journey in fukuoka that we went on back in may neither of us had ever been to that part of japan before and since there were some cheap flights we decided to go explore a new region together here we go we continued our daylong journey through huis ten bosch a dutch towninspired theme park by renting a very unique tandem bike and taking a nice relaxing stroll through the rose garden it was truly a wonder going through such a nice and tranquil place i think everyone else that was there wanted to preserve the peace as well so it was quite quiet despite there being other tourists may saturday last week we left off on this picture of sean on the tandem bike i bet if you were just looking at this picture on its own you wouldnt know this was in japan and even more so with this picture i think they really did a great job recreating the look of a danish town from the cobblestone paths to the europeanstyle architecture it

egituman,qrg6u8,nklm,qrgf6l,,the advantage of the americans was not immediately manifested and in many ways this advantage is required not to engineers but to managers during the lunar program there were a lot of things invented in the technology for managing large projects the same pert there were no valuable engineers of rocket launches to any valuable americans and if you look at the american missile projects of the you are just amusing the low technical level at which they were carried out the americans declared the first serious technological breakthrough only in creating the record engine not surpassed to this day power but the nongermans created the engine and the americans themselves and the von braun first of all tried to bury it the war with this engine went on five years but in the end it was the that brought armstrong to the moon meanwhile a drama in the mirror scenario developed in the ussr having worked out by polishing conkrokutivat and technology by the soviet engineers found that managers were no longer needed the nearby kremlin fuss between the three soviet branches of the authorities the green generals gray chekists and the blue part time functioners pushed all the concerns to the background except for the notorious nuclear shield the lunar project was actually closed immediately with the advent of li brezhnev leaving in essence only an imitation of violent activity with a zero budget it is ridiculous to say but the actual executed estimate of the soviet lunar program turned out to be less than the costs of goskino for the screening of the trilogy war and peace with the bornnadchuk bezukhov the result was predictable by the beginning of the in space we were no longer the united states but even ganduras could overtake us the united states then for the first time the gps space navigation system was deployed our glonass was three years earlier but they threw it out built the first inhabited cosmic the first was our salute but the crew died the first mastered the geostationar orbit with commercial satellites and the first to deduce the first the telescope was the first to send the voyager to the space outside the solar system and then the first account is already in packs the second time the window of opportunities opened in serein with the program of the soviet shuttle buran but the next surge of the kremlin kamarilia drowned her in the first swim,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://image.ibb.co/gTbWmn/nklm1.jpg""}}","{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfEKhUanVmXk4e4wsriex7VgoUGE4Ek4QJLnfkmZxfviq/nkl2020.jpg"",""name"":""nkl"",""version"":2,""location"":""Россия"",""website"":""https://steemit.com/steemit/@nklm/my-blog-navigation-map""}}","{""app"":""steemit/0.2""}",2021-04-12T14:06:27+00:00,52824618,Russia

,aaa,realprince,aaa-wargames-1983,"[AAA] 위험한 게임(Wargames, 1983)", the films made in the past are computer graphics and various technologies but i think there is no big difference from the recent movies sometimes i thought that if i combined this story structure into a database i thought it would be possible to make a tremendous similar movie david attempts to hack around david matthew broderic is a high school student who handles a very well computer i got close to the same class jennifer alison but in class i was ruined and ruined the test so both biology would be failed jennifer who went to davids house was surprised to see him dealing with a computer but he was surprised to see his school computers and modify their f credits to c or a david wants to experience a new game from a game company and want to experience a variety of clues and approach the companys computer start doing it and the producer finds dr falcon john wood and even investigates that he has already died its an old work so im using the phone to access the network with a computer in the movie using a large inch floppy disc also brings nostalgia of course the latest technology but the situation room for wargame is greatly made and it was interesting to be drawn to the current artificial intelligence technology stop artificial intelligence programs in fact davids approached computer was an ai computer that the ministry of defense was trying to try and it was a system that can be automatically judged and fired when the war game was needed and missile launch was needed and the person who designed the computer was dr falcon through this connection his son finds out that his name is joshua and david succeeds in finding out and accessing passwords jennifer and jokes are ordered to blow up seattle and las vegas david and jennifer who didnt know that the computer would actually work was surprised at the news that the nuclear war would happen in the news and the fbi was dispatched to arrest david and then the ministry of defense who found out that he was a joke tries to stop the missile launch order but it doesnt work the structure of the overall film is no different from that of the transformer the protagonist who meets a new technology has a girlfriend and through that technology the protagonist communicates with the technologies that others cannot access and the crisis will come to the crisis and the protagonist will be able to solve this problem so the same it was to years ago but it was more fun in that respect modem floppydisk it reminded me of memories ps photos are taken from pixabay realprince the following part is needed to put filled in and added to your text as otherwise it will not be included later ii on triple a at the bottom of the review the following requirements include movie url critical aa movie url star aa ,"{""profile"":{""name"":""RealPrince"",""cover_image"":""https://tistory3.daumcdn.net/tistory/592034/skin/images/steemit_cover2.jpg"",""profile_image"":""https://tistory3.daumcdn.net/tistory/592034/skin/images/IMG_2318.JPG""}}","{""profile"":{""name"":""RealPrince"",""cover_image"":""https://tistory3.daumcdn.net/tistory/592034/skin/images/steemit_cover2.jpg"",""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmfGQQJmt3ketF73bm39NuD5UbWwwHc6KcxU1HBVh2hi7D/3DBEC975-CF43-439A-9F54-D14244B7524A.jpeg"",""version"":2}}","{""tags"":[""aaa"",""kr"",""zzan"",""liv"",""palnet"",""dblog"",""lassecash"",""neoxian""],""image"":[""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmNLnKnr1puR2i2fSXqNVvnjk5f9CWC6nsypg75ezpdxXz/20210412_fire-and-water-2354583_1280.jpg"",""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmdnGdgBnXv9vLAaFFaX8ftQbJ3KyQZfvfKjArjRU1Jo7m/AAA.gif""],""links"":[""https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/860-wargames"",""https://www.triplea.reviews/movie""],""app"":""triple a/0.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""canonical_url"":""https://www.triplea.reviews/@realprince/aaa-wargames-1983""}",2021-04-12T14:30:21+00:00,52825091,

mission impossible squad and the syndicate terrorist group which consists of former intelligence agents from around the world although the head of the syndicate solomon lane was neutralized by ethan hunt in mission impossible rogue nation his remaining colleagues could bring a lot of trouble it becomes known that they are trying to extract three plutonium charges and assemble portable nuclear bombs on their basis only ethan hunt can prevent the renegades as usual tom cruise probably made a deal with the devil after all how else to explain the fact that from mission to mission he is only getting younger he performs complex tricks himself runs like crazy breaks his legs learns to fly in helicopters how much energy is there in this person perhaps mission impossible fallout is worth watching at least as a motivator maybe at least it will make you exercise in the morning continuing the trend set in the last film in mission impossible fallout tom cruise performs most of the stunts on his own and sometimes they are really difficult stunts if in rogue nation he a big fan of motorcycles underwent special training on stunt driving then during the preparation for the filming of fallout the actor learned how to fly a helicopter seriously cruz himself does some of the helicopter stunts in the epic final chase and its just incredible and by the way it gives an amazing sense of realism which cannot be achieved in films with a green screen in what is happening in mission impossible despite all the madness of some episodes you really believe just compare footage from fallout to recent skyscraper almost entirely filmed with a chroma key it really is heaven and earth reflections glare small details another bonus of real tricks in fallout is the absolutely indescribable expression on tom cruises face when he gets into an accident jumps from an airplane it took about a hundred real long jumps from a height of over m to shoot one landing or crashes his chest into the edge of a building at full speed this perhaps and you will not play by the way tom still broke his leg during filming which led to a sevenweek delay and cost the studio a pretty penny fortunately the insurance covered the costs in general action in fallout is not just a lot but a lot so much so that part of it just didnt make it into the final cut of the film some of the episodes we saw in the trailers will only appear as bonuses on bluray and this is probably for the better even in an abbreviated form the picture stretched out for a good two and a half hours however flew by almost imperceptibly the mission impossible squad team was formed in the previous film it is a pity that jeremy renners hero dropped out of it but we guessed it with the participation of rebecca ferguson in the new film in general by the number of beautiful women in one tape ethan hunt easily plugs bond james bond into the belt in addition to the deadly ilsa faust played by rebecca ferguson the gallant operative is surrounded by michelle monaghan who returned to the role of julia hunt and vanessa kirby the crown everest who plays the fatal white widow everything is great in the new picture and with the locations mission impossible fallout can be used as a guide to both paris the french media just love it and london during a car chase in paris ethan hunt and his pursuers go around it seems all the famous sights of the french capital and during a walking chase in london you can virtually climb the dome of st pauls cathedral and enjoy an unusual view from the rooftops of the city and southerk districts by the way the final fight of the film was not filmed in kashmir at all the stone tongue on which the helicopters of the heroes fall is located in norway this is the famous giant preikestolen cliff above the lysefjord which was closed to tourists for nine whole days whats more impressive about mission impossible fallout is the sound design and soundtrack it is highly recommended to watch this film in a cinema with the highest quality acoustics imax and are of course cool and will not be superfluous here but the sound is much more important before writing this review i was completely sure that hans zimmer wrote the fallout soundtrack imagine my surprise when it turned out that lorne balfe the author of compositions for crysis call of duty modern warfare beyond two souls assassins creed games as well as ghost in the shell films was responsible for the music in the film sherlock holmes and sherlock holmes a game of shadows and the crown and genius tv series on many of the films games mentioned zimmer and balfe have worked together so its no surprise that their styles have become somewhat similar in any case lorne balfes work for mission impossible fallout is really impressive and i would be surprised if the composer does not collect a decent harvest of awards by the end of the year mission impossible fallout is an excellent film in every respect entertaining holistic dynamic against the background of the latest rather weak tapes about bond the same specter and the stumped jason bourne series mission impossible seems to be becoming the main spy action series of the we hope that tom cruise will have enough strength and enthusiasm for at least one more trilogy

,hive-120412,tambi,mission-impossible-fallout-spy-action-cinema,"""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" : Spy Action Cinema",mission impossible fallout continues the story of the confrontation between the mission impossible squad and the syndicate terrorist group which consists of former intelligence agents from around the world although the head of the syndicate solomon lane was neutralized by ethan hunt in mission impossible rogue nation his remaining colleagues could bring a lot of trouble it becomes known that they are trying to extract three plutonium charges and assemble portable nuclear bombs on their basis only ethan hunt can prevent the renegades as usual tom cruise probably made a deal with the devil after all how else to explain the fact that from mission to mission he is only getting younger he performs complex tricks himself runs like crazy breaks his legs learns to fly in helicopters how much energy is there in this person perhaps mission impossible fallout is worth watching at least as a motivator maybe at least it will make you exercise in the morning continuing the trend set in the last film in mission impossible fallout tom cruise performs most of the stunts on his own and sometimes they are really difficult stunts if in rogue nation he a big fan of motorcycles underwent special training on stunt driving then during the preparation for the filming of fallout the actor learned how to fly a helicopter seriously cruz himself does some of the helicopter stunts in the epic final chase and its just incredible and by the way it gives an amazing sense of realism which cannot be achieved in films with a green screen in what is happening in mission impossible despite all the madness of some episodes you really believe just compare footage from fallout to recent skyscraper almost entirely filmed with a chroma key it really is heaven and earth reflections glare small details another bonus of real tricks in fallout is the absolutely indescribable expression on tom cruises face when he gets into an accident jumps from an airplane it took about a hundred real long jumps from a height of over m to shoot one landing or crashes his chest into the edge of a building at full speed this perhaps and you will not play by the way tom still broke his leg during filming which led to a sevenweek delay and cost the studio a pretty penny fortunately the insurance covered the costs in general action in fallout is not just a lot but a lot so much so that part of it just didnt make it into the final cut of the film some of the episodes we saw in the trailers will only appear as bonuses on bluray and this is probably for the better even in an abbreviated form the picture stretched out for a good two and a half hours however flew by almost imperceptibly the mission impossible squad team was formed in the previous film it is a pity that jeremy renners hero dropped out of it but we guessed it with the participation of rebecca ferguson in the new film in general by the number of beautiful women in one tape ethan hunt easily plugs bond james bond into the belt in addition to the deadly ilsa faust played by rebecca ferguson the gallant operative is surrounded by michelle monaghan who returned to the role of julia hunt and vanessa kirby the crown everest who plays the fatal white widow everything is great in the new picture and with

,hive-108800,raquelsiso1,concurso-recomienda-una-serie-o-pelicula-dark-netflix,CONCURSO: Recomienda una Serie o Película // Dark Netflix, very good afternoon to all for today i have brought my participation to the contest organized by imagen where we must talk about our recommendation in the field of series or films in this case i have decided to tell you about a series well known and that they will surely love for this occasion i invite rennyelias and koryutiger i hope you like it d surely many will have heard it it is currently cataloged as one of the best series that the netflix platform has brought us in the decade dark was created by baran bo odar and jantje friese and released for the first time in consists of three seasons being the last launched in before talking a little more about the series i would love to ask you do you like mystery and science fiction time trips the paradoxes the stories complex in which you need much attention or the most important do you want to learn a little about quantum mechanics in a simpler way if your answer is yes then you can prepare for this series to show you that time travel is not something simple history is located in a small fictional town called winden in germany where four families are among its inhabitants the kahnwald the tiedemann the nielsen and the doppler in the city is the nuclear power plant which is about to be closed the story begins without spoiler calm with the suicide of michael kahnwald the head of this family and later in the disappearance of two children entity mikkel nielsen younger son of the nielsen family jonas the only son of the kahnwald family chased by the doubt will be responsible for taking us for this interesting adventure and will realize the secrets of winden of the nuclear power plant and of these families on a trip between the past present and future and it is that a simple phrase that is repeated several times in the series and without a doubt one that could summarize some things is that everything is connected i know that there are one million series and films that have a similar theme and are confusing dark is similar in that aspect the series has a unique way of telling the facts so if you do not pay insurance attention it will be impossible for you to understand many compare this series with stranger things but friends dark is much more complex forces you to think things therefore a pencil and paper will be your classmates on this trip but not everything is both cognitive and rational complexity this is balanced with the factor of human feelings goodness love fear and other things we can see them here where each character it has a development and we can see several facets of the same character which seems to me an excellent complement to accompany the story here we can see how every action of the characters in the past affects the events in the future but this is not between a battle between good and evil all in a certain way they want the same there is also the mathematical physical and mythological and philosophical factor such as the particle of god parallel realities religion ariadna thread lunar cycle among other things but neglect it is not necessary to be a genius in this to understand what happens dark has an interesting story that surely catches and wants to know more and more as you advance you can create your theories and then check if they are correct we can also see that he uses fantasy to talk about existential issues such as the meaning of life the belief of god the reasons for dying the repercussions of our actions undoubtedly dark makes us enter our dark side to decipher where we come from and where we are going in conclusion dark is one of the best series of the platform in case you want something more series that requires a little brain however it is still an interesting reflexive series where you can learn a little about the quantum mechanics of sure you will love and enjoy it in its three seasons by the way something positive of the series is that there is no filling and everything is important to understand the plot this series was seen on december and every day i saw an episode or up to two i saw it on the recommendation of my friend rennyelias you need leaves and pencil and copy some important things also the concepts that mention me to look for it online to have a better idea that they referred to and were easier to understand by the way one thing is that the casting of characters is excellent the adults and adolescents of the characters are so similar to each other so much that they even seem the same person and here an example and do not worry that it is not a spoiler png i hope you liked it thank you very much for reading and see you next d

man who wakes up one day in the body of a young orphan who inherited a store of his parents he receives a message a while after indicating that the system has been synchronized but in this world of martial cultivators warriors and sorcerers his system tells him that his function is to manage a coffeeinternet yes a cybercafe in a world of growers a novel of a certain absurd humor adventures classic videogames and the rise of the cybercafe manager who will become the sacred land of all the powers of his world chapter the darkest moment divine spells use divine spells saint of the claus sword sent by divine nation radiant light finally noticed the strange situation and roared but when he looked at the group of divine spells of the divine judgment palace he saw a horrible scene all the magicians of divine spells seemed stunned with the pupils contracted as if they had sunk into an ocean of fear and were experiencing extremely scary things some of them attacked their companions like crazy and did not stop despite the fact that the latter had become corpses do you really believe that this poorly mixed army can stop us at this time the high and thin figure standing next to the demon dragon of the shadow finally said a lot of idiots we let you think you were at a dead point with us to lower your guard we only did that to end your magicians of divine spells like an invisible nuclear bomb he swept the entire battlefield the shadows in heaven extended through heaven over the city immersing the sky clear in cold and darkness at the nations summit san dulans face became livid at this scene meanwhile all holy level teachers felt that their enemies became more fierce in an instant although the holy level teachers were not influenced by the feeling of fear such as the average warriors and magicians the situation on the battlefield had instantly worsened the soldiers of the shadow legion made their way to their enemies without finding almost any resistance except a few who were still fighting the elite warriors would probably all die in this horrible battlefield if no one could change this situation a ray of black light suddenly shot down the sky the hot blood sprouted and dyed the sky red instantly the holy level warrior dressed in a golden armor was the supreme teacher and the king of the principality of lianshan he had a ugly and shocking wound at the waist where are you looking at before him there was a humanoid monster with a terrifying look blood dripped from the huge sickle leaf in his hand the monster lifted the sickle and licked the blood slightly as if it were savoring a rich wine in the sky a tremendous and terrifying energy met on the horizon and then became a human figure it was san dulan it was the image of the solid figure through visual projection of spiritual spells and this figure contained at least percent of its power with a movement of his hand a layer of mystical light spread under the lighting of light the dense terrifying atmosphere finally dissipated a little however when the lights were attenuated the fear atmosphere began to meet again anyway the warriors who had gone crazy due to fear finally recovered some senses persecuted by the legion of the shadow innumerable soldiers fled at all costs and only less than half were left the previously arrogant human elites rushed to run as if they were scared then the holy level teachers began to retire while fighting under the wild counterattack of the legion of the shadows some of them were injured withdrawal he said the projected figure of san dulan in a deep voice withdrawal remove yourself now santo de la sword claus shouted at this time the figure sitting in the demon dragon of the shadow in the sky finally moved the huge saber wrapped in burning flames was cut and seemed to cut a huge crack in the sky some holy level teachers were the objectives just when they were about to block it they were sent flying by a horrible force some holy level teachers with a relatively low crop force threw blood instantly the rain began to fall from the sky that was becoming even more bleak the rainwater washed the blood from the ground forming streams of a live red and running through the streets and lanes of the city they did they simply fell like this we just lost like this the previously arrogant faces became silent and seemed lost as they looked at this scene they were the strongest and most definitive teachers in the world they had even thought about fighting to death in glory but they had never imagined that they would fail so miserably withdrawal withdrawal withdrawal for them it seemed that the war ended before it really began withdrawal the monster with the upper part of the human body and helmets landed slowly from heaven under the support of horrible rays and hurricanes and descended before everyone he said in a deep and strange voice we would not have wasted so much time and energy if we did not want to gather them all here for destruction we would not have to waste time and find each one of you one by one every word that said seemed to shake the surrounding space and the vast and uncontrollable energy that emitted became hurricanes and even opened the space with a movement of his hand a thick arc of lightning crashed into the visual projection of the spiritual spell of san dulan which instantly shattered in energy debris in the nations summit conferences the evil face without razor of the humanoid creature with a helmet filled the visual projection of the spiritual spell the dwarves elves and the last human teachers were watching this scene he looked at the high sky that seemed to have been immersed in a frightful darkness it seemed that a giant existence had blocked all the sunlight in the sky damn it we cannot project our image in this area what are they doing no we cannot retire at this time the middle aged man dressed in a golden armor who was also the king of liansehans principality and the only holy level teacher of this medium sized nation shouted we cant retire the south of this city was a plain whose end could not be seen with a single look which meant that if this city was lost the legion of the shadow could invade the nation without any resistance if that happened the entire principality of lianshan and its people would be finished we cant retire this man roared in a hoarse voice but nobody seemed to listen to him as they continued to go back do not with a hoarse and desperate roar he saw impotence how the legion of shadows shattered the walls buildings and everything else in the city he crushed everything without mercy before launching towards the center of the principality it seemed to see another human kingdom fall before the legion of the shadows it was a nation built with numerous effort generations we cant retire he grabbed the arm of santo de la sword claus that was sent here by divine nation radiant light claus turned away from the hand with coldness its crazy mr leidon the lightly bald medium sized man looked around with a cold look feeling as if his heart were bleeding when the holy level teachers left one by one the heroic looking young man could not bear it anymore the features of this young man resembled those of the lord of the principality of lianshan and his armor was covered with cuts he raised his sword and carried the enemies with furious roars his chest was crossed by many spears and swords ah the king of median age who was also the only holy level teacher in lianshans principality finally counterattacked i know that a small nation like ours is insignificant despite all this just i cant retire like a maniac he loaded forward and shouted this is my land if i must die i need to die on this earth i will show you that even a small nation has its dignity this man waved his giant sword and blocked many spears swords and other weapons while hot blood spread through the black sky like wolfs mouth at this time wilson suddenly stopped his steps maybe youre right a black tone sickle opened the sky and the saint of the nation protective sword of the empire of the morning light suddenly disappeared in the spot when he appeared again he precisely blocked the mortal sickle if everyone sits and looks like this im afraid no one will help us when we need help the scream upon listening to his words some of the other holy level teachers doubted and finally stopped their steps a lot of idiots several holy level teachers including holy of the claus sword quickly left with their troops without a radiant light

martial cultivators warriors and sorcerers his system tells him that his function is to manage a coffeeinternet yes a cybercafe in a world of growers a novel of a certain absurd humor adventures classic videogames and the rise of the cybercafe manager who will become the sacred land of all the powers of his world chapter for the horde at this time a trace of helplessness and despair appeared in the eyes of these warriors even holy level teachers seemed helpless when their opponents attacked them one by one this was a feeling of helplessness that had never felt before although his army had become even more powerful than they could have imagined the horrible legion of the shadows had destroyed his dream of victory again and again with an overwhelming force the orcs had fallen and then rose again and again but they still couldnt defeat their enemies the horrible power of this legion they faced was beyond their imagination at the nations summit most of the audience felt that their hearts rose and went down with the changes in the situation on the battlefield the process of this war was so exciting that even queen elfa felt uncomfortable despite the miraculous resurrection spells that the alliance army possessed under such destructive attacks queen elfa even wondered if the alliance army on the battlefield would be completely destroyed in the next moment and the old paladin could not be able to save so many people after having used all her energy which would lead to the collapse of the whole war queen elfa even considered whether she should enter the war herself but it would mean that the entire clan had reached the final moment fang qi obviously also noticed this situation is the time suddenly completely black lights opened the sky with whistled acute boom boom bright bonfires exploded in heaven it seemed that almost all meteorite like fireballs exploded in the high sky san dulan who had felt relieved stared at the visual projection of the spiritual spell in front of him whose who these people walked towards the visual projection of the spiritual spell without wanting to miss any detail unconsciously the orc warriors under the meteorites and some warriors and human gentlemen looked up and saw the debris in the sky falling quickly like rays of light burning in ashes before they could reach the ground a black figure jumped into the sky like an sharp arrow he threw his arch to the maximum and then an arrow became a black rainbow shooting in the sky even standing on the ground people could feel the suffocating and powerful strength in the high sky while the black arrow shaped arrow exploded over the huge beast in the sky with a ruthless force strident howls instantly resonated in the high sky meanwhile an acute and deafening whistle seemed to launch an acoustic nuclear bomb on the battlefield sweeping the entire area with its power the orcs looked up and saw a figure covered by a dark red layer he had a bony but beautiful face dark gray skin and long pointed and thin ears dark energy endless that was more horrible than shadows swept with this sharp groan i regret the banshee sylvanas queen sylvanas an orco player shouted from the horde in the other world these players had fought many days and nights for her but they had never imagined that the figure for which they had been fighting would come and guide them in a battle in the real world someday seeing the legendary heroin of the horde fighting with them shoulder shoulder the warmth arose in the hearts of the players while they were amazed an orco picked up a battle flag of the ground and lifted it high with the bright flag waving on the fierce battlefield he shouted for the horde for the horde the orcs of the horde rose from the ground and loaded against the legion of the shadows with their great shields and huge axes again healing totem follow orcos brothers load with me mr dirk shouted for queen sylvanas for queen sylvanas sala and other elves of the horde hastened to follow them wishing that the people who were in front of them could move faster to see queen sylvanas more clearly instantly others followed the load meanwhile the soldiers and monsters of the shadow legion were still stunned by the lament of the banshee and were attacked by the wild orcs and other girrusing warriors a larger wound crossed the legion of the shadows at this time sylvanas flew to the high sky his dark arrows containing cursed power inflicted unimaginable damage in the huge beasts with strident howls they all fell to the ground is this an elf the whole public looked at the queen of the elves by their side at this time queen elfa looked at the visual projection of the spiritual spell with open eyes i do not know either how does this elf not resemble us our elves do not have such dark skin nor the ears so long what is happening i was dumbfounded by the scene this elf does not look like one of us of course queen elfafa could not reveal these thoughts to others it seemed as cold as before when he said lately i have concentrated my mind on the teachings of the elf god and i have not had time to take care of clan affairs the first old man took some elders and travel elves and seemed to have brought many unthinkable things you can ask the first old man after the war ends then he asked are there other elves besides us in this world impossible obviously others had the same thought even princess isabel who had been sitting in silence in her seat launched a quick look at queen elfa and then looked at the new elf in the visual projection of the spiritual spell after that he looked at queen elf again and then returned to the visual projection of the spiritual spell how is it that the skin color of this elf does not look good with this thought he continued looking at war at that time the arrows fell like cannon bullets from heaven beat by the horrible arrows of energy innumerable soldiers and monsters of the legion of the shadows both in the sky and on the ground were sent flying along with everything that surrounded them when sylvanas became a banshee his arrows with the magical power of the silver moon had become arrows of death according to legends the people who were killed by this type of arrow tip would become their slave to death even a scratch from the tip of the arrow would rot the wound continuously and no medicine could cure such wound then everyone saw the soldiers of the legion of the shadows that had been touched by the dark energy of the arrows die while their meat could meanwhile their skeletons rose from their bodies this was a warcraft ability in the system version the characters could use all the spells and skills they had learned in the prequels so their skills were both warcraft and world of warcraft and had readjusted and balanced the soldiers of the legion of the shadows rose from death again and then attacked their old comrades without any emotion at this time even the legion of the shadows which knew nothing more to kill seemed to feel an emotion called fear in their hearts finally the entire legion of the shadows began to collapse you support me if you

jesus cross events and non discourse parabolet saegodo genesaret sudo bonnie galilee pharisees peter passion the decision of dool religious thought through the gospel of mark christianity has no way to disappear from this land because we have already penetrated our soil in order to make christianity into the manure of this land it is necessary to know the nature of christianity knowing the essence of christianity is to find the realism of jesus the only way to find jesus realism is to grasp the original character of mark the first gospel and to read the original text properly this book is the decisive plate of the author dool who reads the gospel of mark creatively without the premise of another gospel or paul based on the greek nuclear power plant the first gospel of the new testament mark gospel mark is the prototype of all the gospels the gospel of mark is a creative literature without the previous model and thus the first gospel literary style has emerged therefore it is certain that the gospel of mark is the original record of jesus life regardless of the east and the west the bible was a supporting document not a reading literature the bible began to read properly as a literature after the bible theology in the early century however even biblical theologians lacked understanding of the original character of the gospel this is because the gospel of matthew in the editorial system of the new testament is the first and mark has given the impression that it is a simple incomplete text that is attached to matthew there are four gospels in the new testament the late john gospel which is the last formed is called the synoptic gospel because it is different in nature and described the three gospel of matthew mark and luke from a common point of view among them matthew and luke are more added to the mark of mark mark is composed of sentences more than of them are in matthew and luke contains the gospel of matthew faithfully inherited the gospel of mark and luke was more freely woven other than mark the bibles gospel began with marks gospel jesus life and yoang gelion drawn in the gospel of mark the gospel of mark begins with the declaration of the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god soon after jesus is baptized by the baptism finally the galilee people are full of time and the order of the kingdom of heaven is approaching changing his heart and shouting to believe in the gospel leaving his symbiosis and we will continue to introduce jesus urgency and death in the order of galilee duo and sidon degada boli and caesara bilipbo the east of the jordan river such as berea the entry of jerusalem the passion and the cross death and the empty grave starting from the galilee region to the gentile area it is to declare a strong message of the religious revolution of the time which is eventually entered into jerusalem and purifying the temple of jerusalem and the end is the cross case in the gospel of mark one third of the whole of jesus suffering persecution and the death of the cross occupy one third of the whole the blessed news of jesus gospel yoang gelion tells us that it is completed by the cross of jesus jesus all teaches his disciples to follow his cross and follow him marks tried to show that there can be no resurrection without suffering and death genius mark proclaiming hope at the end of despair in ad the jewish temple was destroyed by the roman army and the era collapsed in this gloomy time maga saves jesus of his life in galilees rubella years ago and proclaims his words as a message of hope to the people of the day despite the fact that the gospel of mark is the first of the early church kerigma the historical human jesus draws the most original unaffected simple simple and sincere and desperate portrays the depth and editing of marks thoughts that combine the words of jesus words to create urgent contrast and rapidly switch the scene shows a level that any dramatist in human history is difficult to follow mark is a genius thinker and writer who stands at the end of despair and intends to improve the gospel of new hope by fostering jesus in this book dowols mark gospel strong sea the author dool is now trying to convey this living jesus who is blooded in the blood vessels and the pulse to our people in this land to read the gospel of mark properly the ultimate meaning of believing in jesus is that jesus believes in what he did and expresses his willingness to live a life that embodies its value according to the meaning of it to do this we must know what jesus said you need to know exactly you should know that the meaning works correctly to do this we must first read the bible that wrote the words of jesus read it so that the meaning will work correctly so in order to read the gospel of mark properly it is recommended that anyone will be helped by this book dowols mark gospel here the author sticks to the position that the gospel of mark should be read only at the same time all the thoughts of humanity are combined in the interpretation process this book is a monumental writing that presents the horizon of new east west convergence to the human thinking world which compensates dools philosophical thoughts close the publisher book review in the book mark is the first gospel the first gospel literature style has emerged as the gospel of mark mark is the most original record of jesus life the gospel of mark is a unique literary genre called yoang gelion the first in human history if paul was the proclamation of the yuan gelion who proclaimed jesus death maga founded the yuan gelion which proclaims jesus life if the former asked the meaning of jesus cross the latter tries to show jesus life as it is this fact is very important that mark is the first appearance of the gospel the most legitimate way to read mark is not to give any theoretical framework or prejudice furthermore the ultimate meaning of believing in jesus is that jesus believes in the words he did and depends on the meaning of it and expresses his willingness to live a life that embodies its value to do this we must know what jesus said to do this we must first read the bible that wrote the words of jesus paul understood the gospel only in the context of salvation and as a basis for salvation he thought only of jesus death resurrection and return so there was almost no awareness knowledge and interest in jesus life it was the revolutionary nature of marks community that recognized the life of jesus as the gospel mark is the first gospel the feature is concise and in the clarity of focusing the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ means that we are clearly focused on the actions of public ministry that made jesus a christ of course no poisonous story about birth and growth does not appear such a story may be important in the genre of biographic literature in the roman era but it is not important to mark at all the gospel of matthew says that it has been fasted day and night in the wilderness for days but there is no such story in mark the jewish wilderness is a really hot desert and it is physically impossible to fast days there mark is very cool about the realistic situation the kingdom of god was the order of heaven the order of heaven is completely different from the fallen earths order that is galilees realistic order the order of heaven is not an order trapped in the space of heaven it is an order that must come down to the land and become an order of new land at any rate metanoia does not mean repentance which means repentance of the sins in the past but it means change your mind changing thoughts means breaking down existing ideas stubbornness customs and beliefs but i think that the sabbath is for a person and that people are not for the sabbath which is a radical remark that breaks down all legalism religiousism or ideological grunds related to it if a person is not for the government but a word for a person for people governement of the people by the people for the people is a constitution of modern democracy jesus declaration is more it is also much more

,deutsch,isabellaklais,das-land-ist-voll-auskehr-angesagt,Das Land ist voll! Auskehr angesagt!,isabella klais departure we for germany syria cannot be safe and insecure at the same time denmark considers it safe and pushes it off there members of the german bundestag were able to convince themselves years ago that at least parts of the country are undisturbed and peaceful the same applies to afghanistan in terms of men the really endangered women are surprisingly among the refugees in the minority iran complains about the cowardly and lazy defeats of his country which prefer a comfortable life abroad of work in their country a phenomenon that has been observed for decades and seems to be an endemic character there a comparable picture is available in all other countries of origin of social parasites deserters and criminals including illegal immigrants germanys goal must definitely be the repatriation or expulsion all immigrants because refuge is a temporary status that ends with the elimination of the threat situation in the country of origin this creates space for refugees who are currently actually threatened this ends the embezzlement of horrendous billions of tax funds which in view of the corona crisis are urgently used in the country this supports the structure and development of the countries of origin where workers are urgently needed states such as denmark japan and canada give the course you keep in mind how germany would look today if our ancestors had run off cowardly instead of facing the challenge of the construction work only their success made our country which it was until the failure of the failures and traitor regime from kohl to kasner but all of this is completely at stake the citizenship act must be returned from the ius soli to the principle of ius sanguini the parasitic proliferation rate of foreigners is otherwise no stop germany threatens to be among the dictatorship of foreign minorities already unmistakable in the approach and finally such majorities the traditional population then becomes increasingly becoming strangers in their own country when they are already feeling looted dismissed and displaced germany must defend its right to its genuine identity militant the targeted rehabilitation represents a crime in the sense of international law to do this it must be prevented that inner enemies in germany in the network with its exterior complete their destructive work bavaria is free shit the following on vk and thus meets the neuralgic point the generation of the raf usurpates the editorial offices and parliaments what wonders that antifa not only learns the clammy but even open support from the rest of the lines kahanes nagels or saskia eskens compact dedicates left wing baking a special issue in a reader comment it says germany die rather is the battle cry that the demonstrators of the green alternative list gal today bndnis grnen then roared on october for the anniversary of german unity today years later these people sit as good people in office and dignity and destroy our country our freedom and our liberal culture without a large individual case most refugees are given the opportunity to bring their families to germany you dont have to be a prophet or math genius to calculate the upcoming catastrophe in the orient a lot of marriage is quite allowed and also common which means that men can marry several women the number of children far exceeds that of our local population because state alimentation takes place without limits nobody should say that he was not warned humanity is not really important for clerical kleptocrats and humanitarian tugs from the unemployed collective of anti fascist rental nomads in the meantime it is no longer enough to end the further influx of strangers the unsustainable condition of the foreign countrys alienation must be reversed so that germany has a future as a prospering industrial state with a clearly german character the country is currently threatening to become global human garbage

,hive-171319,antikus369,the-diary-game-13-04-2021-sredstva-peredachi-svyazi,THE DIARY GAME: 13.04.2021. Средства передачи связи, communication means telegraph radio telephone internet and other technologies that have already entered our lives tightly with them we already got so compressed that leaving our phone forgetting at home we are already real as we wounded on our heads as if they had lost something valuable we are now so attached to all these phones smartphones tablets laptops computers and instant messengers that we cannot live without them for minutes and just about years ago people somehow lived without all this and nothing they didnt suffer much and no one died they were not lost in urban wilds not everyone and telephones were stationary in general but it was once this is a very long time ago at the dawn of the emergence of even radio everything is different and in history these are certain pages here i would like to tell or even talk about them if someone will be interested so what does history open before us when you get acquainted with similar historical unreal stories you understand how progress and technology still developed rapidly despite all the difficulties associated with the misunderstanding of people officials and large bosses to a greater extent inhibiting the development of not only technological progress but also the history itself such a ruler is obtained from the past to the future telegraph radio phone internet today no one is surprised by the rapid communication by transmitting any signals instantly and this is like various kinds of communications cell phones smartphones messengers and others with lightning speed or fast working devices and programs we already know and use all this in round the clock accessibility we now have many social networks facebook twitter vkontakte and other amenities for the phone skype waiber watsap botim etc and earlier in history there was a telegraph and how a curiosity for a people the emergence of which not everyone knows it all started with the optical telegraph of the french engineer clapt shapp which he invented in the messages at that time were transmitted between cities in only minutesthis was a real revolution in the field of information transmission by the way napoleon using this optical telegraph transferred his orders to the troops which was especially important for conducting hostilities our ivan kulibin also took possession of this technology and regardless of european inventors further for some time there was a connection between cities countries and continents this is a steamboat mail and then all the familiar electric telegraph invented by smmorza in appeared it was from this year that a new era began to transmit information to any distances from europe to america further the telegraph covered all countries around the world entangled in the wires of the city and vesya and now the internet also enveloped all the cities and countries of this world web an electric telegraph was immediately introduced for rapidly developing railways in europe this did not go around the attention of engineers working in russia and then the question is how would these technologies develop up to the present day with the advent of the internet if they had not been born then with the optical telegraph of shapp and kulibin following them an interesting letter of the bodo telegraph apparatus appeared on the basis of which a facsimile apparatus was already manufactured in our time to transmit information by phone and thanks to all these historical inventions today we can easily communicate on the network transmit information of any content and volume from texts and photographs to videos and entire movies in the century journalists understood the great importance of all these technologies that appeared through which it is possible to quickly transmit information to their publishers and already today it is possible to show any reports in real time communicating with a huge audience anywhere in the world and as an addition to everything of course television appeared which we already perceive for granted but what a difficult path was traveled trial and mistakes to get such technologies today for us simply if you think about which giant leap has not even happened in a hundred years but only in years with a little and then the other question is but do we appreciate and understand this i think no a person very quickly gets used to a comfortable environment that we surrounded ourselves today therefore nervous breakdowns are increasingly happening due to the fact that someone suddenly forgot or lost their phone as if he had lost his clone but it in fact is so in just one smartphone a whole life fits today and the whole tragedy loses this life but there are examples when a disaster explosion occurred in fukushima in japan so at this time all these technologies did not work for them and contrary to everything only a stationary phone functioned so that i post all the photos and the time of the year winter not on the topic of my reasoning but they are simply selected to decorate this post or even easier to say i like some of these photos well the rest is my reasoning at the time when i am still sitting at home and gypsum is never removed apparently you will have to sit like that all the same for a month already weeks have passed all contests are organized and supervised thanks to all those who oversee and support the authors in their work additional information original photo first publication cammer sony

,aaa,drax,film-review-the-big-bus-1976,Film Review: The Big Bus (1976), it is often said that parody film airplane by turning out to be ultimate genre spoof ended the disaster epics trend that had dominated hollywood in previous decade its achievement becomes even more notable in light of previous film that tried to do the same comedy the big bus directed by john frawley the plot deals with maiden voyage of cyclops gigantic nuclearpowered luxury bus which is about to start non stop service between new york and denver problems however start even before the voyage bomb explosion forces kitty baxter played by stockard channing daughter of the scientist who had designed the bus to find new driver solution comes in the form of dan torrance played by joseph bologna her old flame whose bus driver career came to screeching halt following the accident in the mountains and subsequent accusations of cannibalism during the voyage he would have to deal with narcoleptic codriver played by john beck attempted sabotage by evil tycoon called ironman played by jos ferrer and dozens of eccentric passengers including some that want to kill him for personal reasons this film share not only similar basic premise with airplane but also a similar approach to humour series of many gags stuffed in relatively short time frame of hour and half in a hope that majority of them would work inevitable comparison between two films however show that the former was less successful mostly due to screenwriters and coproducers lawrence j cohen and fred freeman lacking the talent of jim abrahams and zucker brothers in airplane although some of the jokes work and can make you laugh most of them are either forgettable or difficult to understand without deeper knowledge of economic situation like oil crisis or popular culture despite interesting cast no performance is particularly memorable with joseph bologna apart from appearing in two of the film most funny scenes looking weak compared with similar character played by robert hays in airplane it seems that even producers had some doubts about quality of their work everyone dies laughing promotional tagline gives away lack of confidence that was later justified by this films poor commercial results and subsequent sink into obscurity it looks like the producers invested less in a good script and more in props like the reallife gigantic bus playing cyclops with its dimensions proudly displayed in the introductory scene which was supposed to spoof a space as a result the big bus is a film that could be recommended more to the public transportation history enthusiasts and less to the audience interested in quality comedy rating blog in croatian blog in english leofinance blog cent profile minds profile uptrennd profile hiveonboard rising star game btc donations eth donations movie url critic aa,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/238130627/n772424597_4914_400x400.jpg"",""about"":""Blogger, film critic, columnist (writes in Croatian and English)"",""website"":""https://draxblog.com"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/10/20/18/35/sunrise-1756274_960_720.jpg"",""name"":""Drax"",""dtube_pub"":""os847UMGEX3u7BQpgM3tm6Kuvzjvntueosp5fEhxGFgH""}}","{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/238130627/n772424597_4914_400x400.jpg"",""about"":""Blogger, film critic, columnist (writes in Croatian and English)"",""website"":""https://draxblog.com"",""cover_image"":""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/10/20/18/35/sunrise-1756274_960_720.jpg"",""name"":""Drax"",""dtube_pub"":""os847UMGEX3u7BQpgM3tm6Kuvzjvntueosp5fEhxGFgH""}}","{""tags"":[""aaa"",""film"",""movies"",""review"",""zzan"",""gems"",""movie"",""marlians"",""upfundme""],""image"":[""https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/original/l5n4h4gmRtjfc0BMAXoJa6P9VC5.jpg"",""https://img.youtube.com/vi/hj8agXYwC2o/0.jpg""],""links"":[""https://steemit.com/film/@drax/retro-film-review-2001-a-space-odyssey-1968"",""https://youtu.be/hj8agXYwC2o"",""https://draxblog.com"",""https://draxreview.wordpress.com/"",""https://leofinance.io/@drax.leo"",""https://beta.cent.co/@drax"",""https://www.minds.com/drax_rp_nc"",""https://www.uptrennd.com/user/MTYzNA"",""https://hiveonboard.com?ref=drax"",""https://www.risingstargame.com?referrer=drax"",""https://1inch.exchange/#/r/0x83823d8CCB74F828148258BB4457642124b1328e"",""https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/19133-the-big-bus""],""app"":""triple a/0.1"",""format"":""markdown"",""canonical_url"":""https://www.triplea.reviews/@drax/film-review-the-big-bus-1976""}",2021-04-13T18:03:18+00:00,52857851,

news best countries ranking after several years at no and one at no since the inception of the best countries report canada finally climbed to the no spot in the sixth edition of us news world reports annual rankings released on tuesday the north american country ranked first in both the quality of life and social purpose subrankings meaning that it is seen as a stable and safe society in which individuals can develop and prosper and is open fair and equitable most of the countries that ranked highest for come from western europe but australia new zealand and japan which is ranked no overall also appeared in the top the top countries in the world canada japan germany switzerland australia united states new zealand united kingdom sweden netherlands the best countries the flag draped entrance to the united nations building in geneva switzerland the report formed in partnership with bav group a unit of global marketing communications company vmlyr and the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania is based on a survey that asked more than people from four regions to assess perceptions of countries on different metrics three new countries cambodia el savador and uzbekistan are included in this years report us news introduced new data categories and attributes this year reflecting a world that is much different than it was a year ago after more than a year of a global pandemic the best countries team added the agility subranking which has the following attributes adaptable dynamic modern progressive and responsive the agility subranking carried the greatest weight in producing the overall rankings reflecting a world where countries businesses and individuals that are responsive and adaptable will be rewarded the citizenship subranking was renamed social purpose with new attributes related to racial equality commitments to social justice and climate goals and caring about animal rights new attributes tied to digital infrastructure tourism consumer brands exports and geographical attractions were also added across several existing subrankings tokyo japan march people relax in a park with the tokyo skytree looming in the distance

canada performed strongly in the survey results the team also explored its problematic treatment of first nations people in administering the vaccine the united states coming off a contentious presidential election and now entering its second year of the pandemic that has killed more than people in the country alone moved up one spot in the rankings this year but just barely missed the top five the best countries survey was conducted after the us presidential election how the us sees itself is far different from how the rest of the world sees it only of those surveyed agreed that the country is a good role model in a functioning democracy more than of americans on the other hand agreed with that statement as part of the rankings report us news investigated whether the attempted insurrection at the us capitol on jan affected americas image in the eyes of the rest of the world and why the nation which ranked near the bottom for the racial equality metric cant overcome its original sin of slavery and other injustices much of global public opinion of the us could be tied to the previous administration of president donald trump only about onethird of people polled in a september survey from the nonpartisan pew research center said they have a favorable view of the us and just in people surveyed said they have confidence in the nowformer president what we saw during trumps presidency is that he got overwhelmingly negative ratings around much of the world and that had a real impact on what people think of the united states as a whole says richard wike the director of global attitudes research at pew research center people basically didnt like the fact that he was pulling the us out of international commitments and putting up barriers between the us and the rest of the world in different ways wike adds that the countrys handling of the coronavirus pandemic also hurt our image within the last year or so but he notes that since president joe biden was elected last year perceptions appear to be improving a pew survey released in january found that people polled in france germany and the united kingdom had much more positive reviews of biden compared to trump they expected relations with the us to improve under biden wike says they had a lot of optimism as far as his policies in terms of foreign policy climate change dealing with the pandemic they felt like the us was going to get better on all those fronts respondents in that survey however did also express some concerns regarding the health of democracy in america wike adds another pew survey released on march found that about twothirds of adults in the us believe their political system needs major changes or needs to be completely reformed concerns about political corruption in the country were also especially widespread according to the report corruption is one common denominator for the countries that placed at the bottom of the best countries rankings many countries that ranked lowest overall also had poor scores on the not corrupt attribute this includes iraq which ranked at the bottom of the list both overall and for that attribute specifically countries that scored poorly on the political stability metric also tended to have low overall scores the lowestranked countries in the world iraq el salvador serbia belarus lebanon uzbekistan kazakhstan ukraine oman guatemala china falls two positions from to no overall the country has faced criticism over its opaqueness about the origins of the coronavirus and its human rights record as well as being in contentious trade talks with the us but this hasnt stopped its perceived rise in power china overtook russia to become the no most powerful nation for just behind the united states china also ranked no for the new has strong exports attribute the newly renamed social purpose subranking is mostly populated by european countries but australia canada and new zealand also appear in the top new

,hive-169461,kneelyrac,how-to-format-your-blog,How to Format Your Blog,how to format your hi everyone since some of the filipinos decided to be back on steemit and some of them invited their friends to start their crypto journeyincluding my friends i wanted to share some of the things that i learned in blogging especially on how to format them the same as you guys if not all but mostly my journey in cryptocurrency started here on steemit i was motivated to write back then because i was determined to have an extra income so i can attend the concert of my favorite japanese rock bandone ok rock in manila philippines i thank junebride and since these three were the keys to why i found steemit i would be a hypocrite if i say i love writing that is why i am here no i am here because i love to write and need extra money hitting two birds with one stone sounds really good but to earn you should know what you give is what you receive it doesnt mean that if you write something here then you will be rewarded with such a huge upvote keep in mind that you should make your blogs interesting intriguing and pleasing to look at its one of the many ways to attract readers also build your audience through engaging anyway what im going to share with you are some of the things that i keep in mind when i write and format my blogs title your title should be catchy but not too fancy intriguing but straight to the point and not wordy in formatting the title or header remember to follow the standard rules for title capitalization capitalize the first and last word every first letter in a word should be capitalized except for the articles a an the prepositions and conjunctions do not punctuate your title except when necessary for example a moment to remember art a body of a woman if you look closely at the second example a colon is used after art followed by an article a without the colon a should be in the lowercase then on the second article a it is in lowercase because as mentioned earlier articles should be in lowercase except when it is used as a first word like example number you can check if you are following the standard title capitalization through this site capitalize my photos before raw file after edited via snapseed not everyone is a photographer not everyone has decent cameras but everyone has a mobile phone with that download and install a photo editor mobile app edit the photos when you can when capturing focus on the subject it is more appealing when the story you are sharing has some photos where the readers could see and visualize it even more in my case i use snapseed and camera sometimes i use lightroom i am using my fouryearold mobile phone and the quality is not that good but i take time to enhance the photos before posting them markdown there are already many markdown tutorials on the internet some are applicable on steemit but some are not when writing a blog make sure you format the body orderly headers adding headers to your blog provides emphasis on the topic this way the reader will have a hint as to what the next sectiontopic is all about the title is header then the next headlines i will use the succeeding header numbers i rarely use header and since they are quite big for me code header header header header header header header header header header header header preview header header header header header header header header header header header header in placing the headers i like placing them at the center code headline preview headline if there is a need to put a subheadline i use a line break and subscript code headline subheadline preview headline subheadline alignment photos photos are essentials in blogs but be mindful of the arrangement of the photos that your blog will not look like a blog with photo dumps the default alignment of steemit markdown for photos is on the left side to avoid editing your photos in layout use the pull left and pull right note that when using pull left and right use the generated image link only erase the following and the open and close parenthesis code div preview div code div preview div for a photo to be placed alone whether it is in portrait or landscape orientation i make sure to add a center code code preview caption it is best to put some decent caption on your photos to add a precise story behind that picture it doesnt need to be a paragraph long when adding a caption make sure to include it at the center also i use the subscript for the caption this is to separate the caption from the normal text code breakfast with argine ate syrah and ivan preview breakfast with argine ate syrah and ivan code the once in a blue moon breakfast preview the once in a blue moon breakfast text the same with the photo the default format in steemit for the normal text is left as for me i like justifying the text like how a paragraph should be written on the paper before anything else i will set first that my blog should be

,hive-185836,gabmr,digital-image-for-the-day-your-writing-story-competition-108-or-or-gicers-world,Digital image for the day (your writing story competition(108)) || Gicers' World, a gicers world in my countless travels through the multiverse i have witnessed any number of amazing things in addition to filming for my civilization i have passionately noted down the most fascinating facts that my four eyes have seen among semiartificial worlds and irregular galaxies i believe that not even the most imaginative minds of the project a great initiative of my home planet lakium could imagine even a quarter of what i have witnessed thanks to nuclear fusion dematerialization technology to give you an idea of the incredible things i have experienced i will give you the case of the last planet i visited it is a planet where blue and green skies predominate just like mine the rain is abundant but it is not intense and flows horizontally i noticed that with it went twoheaded creatures with elongated bodies then when i looked deeper i discovered that there was another one below although as it was identical to the one i first saw i thought it was just a reflection soon after i realized that it was an independent sea in some areas of the sea rested supposed rock formations which every minutes changed not only their position but also their own shape it was something that intrigued me of course but when i decided to get closer the whole picture changed the colors of the planet became warm the gravity increased considerably and from the sky any number of electric explosions emerged while the rain began to be vertical it looked like the beginning of a battle and so it was because in a snap the belligerents appeared face to face cyborgs chimzos nucleararmed primates gicers native race bicephalous creatures dragons litums spheroid beings of electricity gicers golems it was amazing to see how the rock formations of before the supposed mountains rose up and created whirlpools in the sea after their footsteps these giants were the ultimate definition of golem the electrical explosions in the sky were actually restless creatures whose heartbeat was expressed just like that exploding moreover thanks to a greater concentration of the twoheaded creatures i could figure they resembled the primitive dragons seen in the milky way but the most developed and imposing of the native side were the gicers their matriarch appeared and her thick voice spread across the battlefield i activated the intergalactic translator and listened you cyborgs were born corrupted your existence marks the greatest example of the greed of your predecessors the humans to overtake and take away any welfare of your fellows and then go after every civilization they found and repeat the process the cyborg leader whom i have long known as rose to look directly into the eyes of the gicer matriarch and said behind our suffering to survive there are many reasons that no one could understand least of all you gicers whose planet of infinite resources has always made life easier for you the gicer matriarch did not like this comment and immediately emitted a roar that i felt hit my whole being in the front line of humanoid combat were the chimzos they were emitting grotesque noises as they were powering their nuclear weapons with vehemence each impact on the native troop seemed like the birth of a new sun however they resisted as if they were mere scratches after a few minutes the twoheaded dragons were one with the litums and pierced the chimzos like spears without any response from them other than screams of pain for their part the gicer golems as colossal as they were served as an impenetrable shield for the gicers no matter the hydrogen cannons or the thousands of cyborg nanoexplosives the golems were indestructible in fact their adamantine structure seemed to glow brighter after each attack apart from this the gicers complicated any humanoid maneuver by their control over gravity it is said that this cosmic dust race has absolute control over every aspect of their planet they did not seem to exert themselves too much on the battlefield with just the movement of their limbs they slowed down the cyborgs in one way or another when the humanoid side was mortally reduced activated an extremely powerful magnetism and absorbed what was left of his subordinates until he transformed into a giant version of himself he then easily took down several golems with plasma weapons and stopped the litums dragons with an anticonductive shockwave that caused them to fall like insectoids into the sea right after this counterattack i noticed how the matriarch gicer changed her grayish coloration to a very bright pink she lifted each of her eight limbs and with a slight waving motion brought the deceased on her side back to life in an instant i was stunned and i saw that in too this technology or gicer power was far beyond anything my civilization could do let alone cyborgs this master move left paralyzed but not having finished her game yet the matriarch dismantled entire machinery turning his body into a magneto just as the cyborg did before in a matter of milliseconds the matriarch opened a dimensional portal and made everything that had been and his barbarian army enter it the sky regained its serene colors and rain flowed like an ocean current again i wanted to continue recording more about that fascinating event and planet but i had to dematerialize frantically when the matriarch appeared in front of me with a territorial character it was an unforgettable scare still crossing this new galaxy i wonder if i will continue to wander through the known multiverse or some illusory gicer dimension thank you so much

,hive-108800,raquelsiso1,concurso-recomienda-una-serie-o-pelicula-dark-netflix,CONCURSO: Recomienda una Serie o Película // Dark Netflix, very good afternoon to all for today i have brought my participation to the contest organized by imagen where we must talk about our recommendation in the field of series or films in this case i have decided to tell you about a series well known and that they will surely love for this occasion i invite rennyelias and koryutiger i hope you like it d surely many will have heard it it is currently cataloged as one of the best series that the netflix platform has brought us in the decade dark was created by baran bo odar and jantje friese and released for the first time in consists of three seasons being the last launched in before talking a little more about the series i would love to ask you do you like mystery and science fiction time trips the paradoxes the stories complex in which you need much attention or the most important do you want to learn a little about quantum mechanics in a simpler way if your answer is yes then you can prepare for this series to show you that time travel is not something simple history is located in a small fictional town called winden in germany where four families are among its inhabitants the kahnwald the tiedemann the nielsen and the doppler in the city is the nuclear power plant which is about to be closed the story begins without spoiler calm with the suicide of michael kahnwald the head of this family and later in the disappearance of two children entity mikkel nielsen younger son of the nielsen family jonas the only son of the kahnwald family chased by the doubt will be responsible for taking us for this interesting adventure and will realize the secrets of winden of the nuclear power plant and of these families on a trip between the past present and future and it is that a simple phrase that is repeated several times in the series and without a doubt one that could summarize some things is that everything is connected i know that there are one million series and films that have a similar theme and are confusing dark is similar in that aspect the series has a unique way of telling the facts so if you do not pay insurance attention it will be impossible for you to understand many compare this series with stranger things but friends dark is much more complex forces you to think things therefore a pencil and paper will be your classmates on this trip but not everything is both cognitive and rational complexity this is balanced with the factor of human feelings goodness love fear and other things we can see them here where each character it has a development and we can see several facets of the same character which seems to me an excellent complement to accompany the story here we can see how every action of the characters in the past affects the events in the future but this is not between a battle between good and evil all in a certain way they want the same there is also the mathematical physical and mythological and philosophical factor such as the particle of god parallel realities religion ariadna thread lunar cycle among other things but neglect it is not necessary to be a genius in this to understand what happens dark has an interesting story that surely catches and wants to know more and more as you advance you can create your theories and then check if they are correct we can also see that he uses fantasy to talk about existential issues such as the meaning of life the belief of god the reasons for dying the repercussions of our actions undoubtedly dark makes us enter our dark side to decipher where we come from and where we are going in conclusion dark is one of the best series of the platform in case you want something more series that requires a little brain however it is still an interesting reflexive series where you can learn a little about the quantum mechanics of sure you will love and enjoy it in its three seasons by the way something positive of the series is that there is no filling and everything is important to understand the plot this series was seen on december and every day i saw an episode or up to two i saw it on the recommendation of my friend rennyelias you need leaves and pencil and copy some important things also the concepts that mention me to look for it online to have a better idea that they referred to and were easier to understand by the way one thing is that the casting of characters is excellent the adults and adolescents of the characters are so similar to each other so much that they even seem the same person and here an example and do not worry that it is not a spoiler png i hope you liked it thank you very much for reading and see you next d

,kr,sanha88,1912-4-14,1912년 4월 14일 타이타닉의 바이올린,april titanics violin im a very unfaithful christian but i am a song that i like when asked what my favorite hymn is its a song called this is the title of protestant hymns and in catholics there is only a song that only the lyrics are different the tune is called irish folk song it is often said that irish people share the most similar emotions to koreans among europeans thats why this song fits very well with korean sentiment in the old days in one special drama the tragedy of the suwon jeam ri church that is the japanese troops trapped the villagers in the church and replayed the incident that the villagers were burned and killed in addition if you examine korean christians favorite hymns it is a song that is in the rankings there was a time when the song resonated deeply into the hearts of more than million koreans which was when the movie titanic was released luxurious passenger ships that collide with icebergs and sinking the decks of inclined ships cowardly struggles and cowardly courage and the string quartet titanics orchestra who had been playing several songs to appease people who were in panic and to do their duties finally decided to break up the instrument as soon as the members share their handshake and turn their backs the chief player starts to turn on the violin it was the titanic orchestrian colleagues stop by this melody and return to their place to proceed with the ensemble during this spleen and bustling hymn the captain ends in the captains office and the poor immigrant mother sleeps on the bed and the elderly couple will be dragged from the cabin where the water has already begun to fill up if you watch the movie you will remember the melody of string which was so soft and sad that it was more beautiful this scene replays a famous true story according to the survivors of titanic the orchestra played until the boat was tilted and could not be centered what would have been comforting before death but because of the music people may find the hope of life and rather than being ugly with the obsession with a hopeless life it seems that he would have been killed by raising the last prayer godly and calmly the chief player of this band was wolis hartley and unlike the four musicians in the film all eight musicians were ensemble until the end they were all destiny and destiny without being on lifeboats the ships dispatched for the body after the titanic sinked and found a body of districts floating in the sea or hanging on icebergs while wearing a life saving vest among them was the body of wallace hartley he had a bag of violin on his neck it is estimated that hartleys body has emerged in the water because of the buoyancy of the bag and the violin who did not want to let go of the last musician was buried in his hometown not in the dark sea through titanics survivors his last struggle was already famous throughout england when hartleys funeral was held in his hometown people gathered and honored him but willis hartley had a fiance it was a man named maria robinson in the beginning hartley was reluctant to go on a long distance sailing with her freshly engaged however he was fascinated by the title of the worlds largest luxury passenger ship titanic the violin that hartley played until the last moment of titanic was the gift of his fiance maria robinson although the violin luxury machini label was attached it was a corner or replica willis hartley was the same but maria robinson wouldnt have been rich the violin bag which made hartleys body stay on the water was engraved with wallace hartleys names initial w h and h and the violin body was engraved with this text for wallace on the ocassion of our engagement from maria wallace celebrates our engagement traces of a woman and until the end a mans relic that is performed for unhappy people with the violin and is sucked into the black and cold sea water to avoid removing it from the body

on saturday march message url many have died by suicide this morning i visited a particular part of purgatory which was overcrowded with very sad and depressed souls a place of torment the angel then took me away from that place and as we started to walk away from them the angel stopped turned to me and said i have to tell you some very sad news do you know how many people on earth die by suicide each day it is like a pandemic many have died by suicide in new zealand quite surprised new zealand i said he said many there die from despair everywhere in australia too but most of them that commit suicide and die are in japan and malaysia for every little thing that worries them or for which they feel guilty they cannot take the pain and they commit suicide but this is also happening throughout the world would you like to know why what is the reason for all of this i listened to the angel as he explained he said they use too many electronic devices and that makes them very depressed there is no one to help these people majority of suicides are by young people the only solution for all these people is to teach them how to cultivate and touch the soil the earth is healing there is something in the soil that when they touch it and mix it that helps make the person better he continued touching and turning the soil is good all these electronic objects affect the mind and body of people youd better tell people and let them know how dangerous electronic devices are as the angel was talking he was tilling the earth with his hands god gave the earth to people as a healing for them there is something very special in it a lot of goodness for your mind and body he said i said thank you my guardian angel thank you lord jesus for teaching us about your special creation for humanity lord have mercy on us and help us and protect especially the young people visionary clare du bois heartdwellersorg taos nm received on friday april message url wait on my timing april may the lord give us the courage and love to give to him unceasingly during this season amen sometimes waking up can be really toughif you know what i mean this morning was no different so i pulled a holy rhema card and it said be prudent be wise wait for my timing and you will be happy and what that has to do with is yesterday the lords supper readings were about the rapture again i was examining my thinking and wondering all these awesome hints that we are getting and yet everyone is talking about all the wonderful things that are coming soon could they be referring not to the rapture but to an entirely new way of life that will come with this tesla energy and med beds so i asked ezekiel my husband what is the lord was saying to you and he said he got three rapture readings from the lords supper and a rhema card as well as on our rhema page by the way if you have not yet tried that please check it out heartdwellersorg go to the rhema page and when you click on the button it will bring up a holy saying of encouragement or instruction do pray before you click and you will be shocked at how accurate the words are for your particular situation a word in season anyway after ezekiel told me that i thought to myself surely the rapture is soon and i was thanking god because i was tired but thinking lord there is so much i want to do for you could you just restore some of my youth i mused then i pulled another card and it said lean on the one who loves you and so this morning when i awoke and put on my armor i was in the kitchen feeling like i was about to die and said lord i am going to lean on you today so when i leaned on him in the spirit and he became visible and answered me not visible to the naked eye but visible in the spiritual eye ok so he said can you offer this to me the pain and the weakness i answered yes lord i offer it to you but please help me not to be lazy he said beloved this week will be full of trials you do not have to invent any penances life will offer them to you daily receive these from my hand with great affection and offer them for souls and the state of the world contrary to all the positive things that are being said on the truthful channels you are in a state of war and things could get out of hand very quickly which is what the remaining black hats are going to try and do but understand the alliance of nations that have come up against this nefarious force have made a noticeably big impact and what is left of them is disheveled a disheveled network that still has nuclear options prayer has done more than i could write in a thousand books about this situation keep praying and remember the scriptures say that when the restrainer that is the holy spirit dwelling in every believer when he is lifted and removed then will the worst calamities occur what i am saying to you is that there is a war to end all wars on the horizon and the enemy is poised for it you and all the others who are praying are holding it back but to

,news,harveyjerry640,beijing-views-taiwan-as-a-breakaway-province,Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province.,taiwan has said a record number of chinese military jets flew into its airspace on monday the defence ministry said aircraft including fighters and nuclearcapable bombers entered its socalled air defence identification zone adiz on monday the incursion is the largest in a year and comes as the us warns against an increasingly aggressive china beijing views taiwan as a breakaway province however democratic taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state the latest chinese mission involved fighter jets as well as four bombers which can carry nuclear weapons two antisubmarine aircraft and an early warning aircraft taiwan said china and taiwan face off in pineapple war china warns taiwan independence means war whats behind the chinataiwan divide the defence ministry added they dispatched combat aircraft to warn the chinese jets while missile systems were deployed to monitor them china has carried out regular flights over the international waters between the southern part of taiwan and the taiwanesecontrolled pratas islands in the south china sea in recent months mondays incursion also saw the jets fly into the adiz to the southwest of taiwan near the pratas islands the latest incident came a day after us secretary of state antony blinken said the united states was concerned about chinas increasingly aggressive actions towards taiwan in an interview with nbc he reiterated that the us had a legal commitment to taiwan and said washington would make sure taiwan has the ability to defend itself adding that it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the status quo by force analysts say beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that taiwans government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and wants to warn president tsai ingwen against taking steps in that direction president tsai however has repeatedly said that taiwan is already an independent state making any formal declaration unnecessary the island has its own constitution military and democratically elected leaders china has not ruled out the possible use of force to achieve unification with taiwan china and taiwan the basics china and taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the chinese civil war in beijing has long tried to limit taiwans international activities and both have vied for influence in the pacific region tensions have increased in recent years and beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back although taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries like most nations the us has no official diplomatic ties with taiwan but a us law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself last month china banned taiwanese pineapple imports citing the risk of harmful creatures that could affect its own crops the move infuriated taiwans leaders who said the move had nothing to do with bugs and was instead an example of china ramping up political pressure on the island which beijing considers a province of china in response taiwans leaders sought out new customers overseas and asked locals to eat what chinese consumers no longer could taiwanese pineapples are stronger than fighter jets geopolitical pressures cannot squeeze their deliciousness declared taiwans vice president lai chingte in a tweet according to taiwans council of agriculture the island produces tonnes of pineapple annually and exported a little over of that last year with almost all of it going to china without mainland sales taiwanese growers face a possible

silver moon and the dwarf kingdom and they could not arrive on time they established and continued looking at the nations summit while the winding mountains rivers and forests quickly passed below it mr fang suddenly received a system message at this time i was reading the message in the system interface mr fang looked at the task list new task milagro de la luz task description takes a glorious victory with holy light to the new store elements of assistance for tasks the symbol of life bearer rock used task reward carrier rock yes the two previous carrier rocks were elements for the task but this was for him this was another powerful triumph letter after receiving the reward of the new task mr fang saw two other indications one was about the launch time of the war of warcraft expansion the burning crusade the burning crusade and the other was about a new game mr fang was about to read the messages when the sky around him suddenly lit a huge black vortex floated in the sky on the endless snowy mountains and aspired countless winds and snowflakes as an unfathomable black hole we should leave now the magician mark tall and thin with a black cape the pain teacher looked at the sky and seemed to realize that people were looking at them however it seemed that this magician did not pay much attention how do we deal with this man the young man who seemed to be in the twenties looked at the surroundings should we sacrifice it pain master mark sounded gloomy and cold as if he were the god of death by issuing a sentence our god will find this kind interesting its finished the beautiful face of queen elfa kellybel looked sad because the commander who had led the alliance army to a great and glorious victory would die in this place in that way oh this is really a hero worthy of praise said the dwarf king with a deep sigh however a trace of undetectable pleasure crossed st dulans face look this is the price you have to pay maybe only the princess can save him but now its too late said the world magician hematon at this time these people have already seen that the figure sitting on the demon dragon of the shadow cutting with his demonic sword that was wrapped in burning black flames after witnessing the horrible power of the previous sword cut these people could feel the horrible strength contained in the sword even through the visual projection of the spiritual spell this sword would probably destroy fang qi and also destroy the mountain where fang qi was standing in the dwarf kingdom the king hit the stone table in front of him and broke it at this time even the teachers who had retired from the battlefield but still had a certain sense of honor squeezed their fists unconsciously however st dulans lips curved slightly boom with a shocking noise horrible waves of air swept surrounding snow like a storm it seemed as if a nuclear pump exploded in the nevada mountain next they all saw something incredible the floor on which fang qi was intact an arm wrapped in a black glovelete had caught the black demonic sword under the huge leaf there was a figure that had silver white hair and wore a red jacket did you kidnap me and you even want to kill me a voice sounded casually thats not pleasant this voice and that tone st dulan sword saint claus and world mage hematon exchanged a look when they heard the voice and tone they would

version of photoshop anyway artweaver allows you to perform most standard photoediting operations efficiently it far surpasses the builtin editors of graphic viewers gimp platform windows mac os linuxubuntu gimp is one of the oldest raster graphic editors thats free to use since its early release in it has a wide and devoted user base with many tutorials and documentation available online up until the year many new users were skeptical towards adopting the program since for years it has had issues such as outdated ui jagged brush work and poor performance on new pcs however the big april update addressed all of these being the result of six years of work the previous version of gimp was released in unlike other free digital art software gimp was designed to be a full replacement for photoshop this means you can use it for digital painting but its really meant for graphic design photo editing text effects and similar features gimp was always more of an image editing program than a drawing one with all the latest updates its functionality is almost on par with photoshops this free painting software has a large number of tools that are available in photoshop layers masks color grading smart selection brushes filters and tons of other features the other tools can be added by using thirdparty extensions however the interface and hotkeys are peculiar here if youre used to photoshop youll have to relearn the interface might seem a bit cluttered compared to krita and photoshop but with use youll get used to it in an instant gimp allows easy integration with several programming languages such as python perl scheme etc its highly customizable ui gives artists the power and flexibility to create their unique designs the painting tools are reasonable although in my opinion krita is a stronger option if you just need painting this is especially useful if you want to not only draw and paint but also do some photo manipulation and finetune your own photos however gimp has a lot to offer digital painters as well the newest version includes longawaited updates for the brush work symmetry painting hardware pixel processing and canvas management rotating flipping previewing granted you can find plenty of free gimp brushes all made for digital drawing amp painting gimp supports almost all the image file formats such as pdf jpg gif pcx mpeg bmp tga tiff xpm png etc developers also polished psd import and added new image formats openexr rgbe webp hgt paintnet platform windows paintnet literally looks like ms paint its a great free alternative to photoshop and gimp the developer actually aimed to make paintnet a more sophisticated version of microsoft paint paintnet is obviously more advanced and it can do complex tasks like using multiple layers and blending while it manages to maintain a userfriendly interface thats intuitive this free digital art software perfectly copes with the task of drawing volumetric models moving objects and transparent structures the tool supports all the features one may need for allaround editing of images layers adjustment modes and special effects you can get rid of red eyes blend images or adjust color as effectively as with any other featureloaded analogue paintnet also supports extensions if you want to expand its capabilities it is a userfriendly drawing tool and you can do amazing works with it the collection of paintbrushes is common to all painting software its easy tools and layers made it special for image editing and manipulation work additionally this free paint program allows you to get images from the scanner and enhance it you can use a pencil pen paintbrush etc in different sizes here it allows you to insert various shapes like square rectangle circle available texts stars shape arrow etc will amaze you various effects such as blur sharpness etc are very attractive in this software and there are no simple words for tools the tools are amazing and they will give you a premium feel in your drawing paintnet does not offer some of the features photoshop and gimp offer like supporting psd files but you can install plugins such as a psd plugin to access those files it just doesnt offer some features natively paintnet is one of the fastest image editors available and it can run in almost two dozen different languages some important features are missing in this apps such as dodge and burn tool limited brushes another problem is you cant edit texts after applying effects though this software has some issues it has many other special offers so if you want you can give it a try it is a perfect match for those looking for quick photo and image editing without skimming through pages of tutorials and additional menus besides it can work quickly even on lowpowered devices the graphics tablet the main drawing tool of the digital artist is undoubtedly the graphics tablet you can choose between a tablet with a screen allowing you to see what you are drawing directly on the operating area or a tablet without a screen which are more affordable and more transportable with or without a screen it allows you to retranscribe your drawing directly onto your computer screen taking into account,{},"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmeJEeo9y5RY6U3B93RxiZbJJhvw2edUwu8tozHoEH6NkS/girl%20model.jpg"",""name"":""Amy

,hive-184714,frafiomatale,a-volte-ritornano-il-resto-dello-steem-14-02-21,A VOLTE RITORNANO - Il resto dello Steem 14.02.21, the other language versions will be available in a few minutes sometimes they return sarri and allegri from marginalized to super requested a curious destiny has united maurizio sarri and max allegri the last two technicians to sit on the bench of the juventus before andrea pirlo and both capable of winning the championship at the helm of the black and white team neither of them managed to find another job in the season or in the seasons since for allegri there are now two following that of leave for both he weighed perhaps more than the lawful the mediocrity of the european journey but also the rich salary that kept them linked to the champions of italy difficult to equalize for many realities time is gentleman it is said and always returns to anyone who is on the side of reason the recognition of their merits they noticed in turin where perhaps because they are convinced that they can win the title almost for inertia also for the tenth consecutive season they have chosen to entrust the team to a debutant coach as far as interesting ideas such as andrea pirlo but winning which has been thought of in the last ten years is never easy or discounted and even among the fans of the vecchia lady we begin to look at the coaches of the latest successes with different eyes of allegri and of his rapprochement with andrea agnelli has been spoken of it already in recent days the derby to which the two witnessed together in the residence of the former juventus coach in forte dei marmi in a period in which italy was in the red area without however scandalizing even a journalist was read a little from everyone as a sort of warning to the team and to pirlo attentive max is free and helpful do your duty or from next year you change register the feeling is that sundays game with atalanta will coincide with the real litmus test of the juventus season a sort of last beach not to be failed for any reason in the world losing in bergamo would mean probably to leave fourth place definitively with the farewell probably immediate of pirlo and the official of the return of allegri on the black and white bench which could even resume the turn of the ship immediately to finish the season trying to save the salvable and start setting the next one however things go to the juventus which in any case has not yet abandoned the idea of granting a second possibility to the current technician allegri is still ready to return to the track starting next season the livornese coach for the esteem and friendship that binds him to agnelli has granted precedence to juventus and will wait a few more weeks before making a decision and possibly accept the offers that the have been delivered in the last few days it is not a mystery as in italy several teams will change leader from next year and the revolution could also involve the rome of the friedkin at the short irons with fonseca and which for some time has entertained with allegri a cordial interview aimed at probing its availability however for max some possibilities abroad would also be opened in the last hours with the arsenal eager to quickly archive the disappointing season in the championship which would have chosen the two time finalist of champions league to undertake a new cycle for irony of fate however allegri and sarri could once again cross their destinies in premier league in a sort of personal play off if the first has deprived the former coach of naples of the possibility of becoming the italian champion in however allowing the latter to take revenge by repinciating it on the bench of the juventus the balance could break just next year in the land of albione since the tottenham has shown great interest in sarri and his ideas disappointed by the experience with the ex special one jos mourinho which for a few years has not hit one more one even by mistake but continues incredibly to be called now here now the spurs would have identified just in sarri the right profile to set up a new project on the medium term from scratch aiming to become a cheeky and unscrupulous team free to play without the axillo of the results in order to create the right environment to develop i football concepts of the tuscan technician the previous english experience of sarri on the bench of the chelsea and the victories in europa league and serie a would make the risk acceptable for the leadership of the tottenham which it would repeat more than willingly the season of the city rivals which ended with european triumph and a third place in the championship sarri against allegri so a duel that begins to become a classic of our football and that is not said however that it cannot become reality again in italy again winning coaches in the end there are not so many and for the future it will be good that he has them if he keeps them tight does the audience return to serie a towards the restart in the next few days with spectators the official reopening in june of the olympic stadium in rome on the occasion of the four games of the european championships made a great sigh of relief to the whole world of italian sport who if he had chosen to follow the path taken by other nations the renunciations of ireland germany and spain probably would have irreparably lost the opportunity to host part of the event thus renouncing all the positive repercussions that also achieve it at an economic level for those like me who do not consider the entry into sicureza of a few thousand people in an outdoor system an excessive risk for health the news can only be positively interpreted although the timing with which these decisions are you are taken about two months in advance leave a little perplexed on the abilities of the health authorities to predict the future however all that remains is to fight and take note of how fortunately at least in the short term the situation seems to improve it also appears rather evident that to get to host about twenty thousand spectators on the occasion of italyturkey of june the system of reopening and assignment of the places must be tested and for this reason it starts insistently to speak of one next reopening of the stadiums for the last days of the championship it will probably be at the beginning of repeating the experiment of the thousand spectators already put in place at the beginning of the season and then moved on to occupy sectors of the increasingly broad stadiums someone well informed seems to have argued that about five thousand spectators will begin to be seen for the month of may and that the italian cup final scheduled for may at the mapei stadium in reggio emilia between juventus and atalanta will serve as a real test for europeans since the filling of of the places should be allowed we are then returning to a gradual normality to complete hopefully for the beginning of her next season obviously it is still early to say it but it is important that in spite of the first bad moods raised in these days by the various taking advantage of duty football takes the first steps to allow it to be imitated to other closed and outdoor sports too and to the concert sector penalized in the same way in the whole sports world by the closure and ban on the use of the stadiums the relaunch of the economy must also start from sport we hope that from here on to deal with them they are correctly illuminated minds the centralized var room is now official it has been made official a few hours ago through a press release issued by the lega serie a the creation for the next season of a centralized var room it is attracted to which all the images of the matches of the championship will pass so lets forget small narrow rooms in some cases obtained inside coaches in which the images in contact with the referees on the field were confined and we welcome a new modern structure consisting of twelve technological rooms which it will become the reference point of all the referees for next year this evolution of the instrument is part of the creation of a television production center of the lega serie a strongly desired by the president of the figc michele gravina if on the one hand all this will save on the costs of the transfer of the referees guaranteeing them also greater comfort on the other it could also lead to some not indifferent problems in the case of any disservices in the centralized var room which they will risk from now forward to make the tool unavailable in all games in that case no one would be in the role of the rei referees of some possible mistake cropped jpg nole still too strong sinner ko it did not make it jannik sinner to tick it against the number one in the world novak djokovic in the sixteenth finals of the master of montecarlo showing that he is still too unripe in order to be able to aspire at the highest levels in a short time however the six games collected on the land of the principality against the world recordman of the atp rankings are however to be considered a fair result for our bearer who continues to not find the same feeling shown on the red surface on the fast unfortunately they did not go better matteo berrettini the real great disappointment of this tunro eliminated in two sets from the spanish class davidovich fokina salvatore caruso which was however credited with a few chances of success against rublev and marco cecchinato ousted from the tournament at the hands

two main ways the first is through shooting and recording techniques through film cameras this method is done by photographing images or objects the second uses traditional animation techniques this method is done through computer graphic animation or cgi techniques both can also be combined with other techniques and visual effects filming usually takes a relatively long time it also requires a job desk each starting from the director producer editor wardrobe visual effects and others definition and definition of film movie while the players who play a role in the film are referred to as actors men or actresses women there is also the term extras that are used as supporting characters with few roles in the film this is different from the main actors who have bigger and more roles being an actor and an actress must be demanded to have good acting talent which is in accordance with the theme of the film he is starring in in certain scenes the actors role can be replaced by a stuntman or a stuntman the existence of a stuntman is important to replace the actors doing scenes that are difficult and extreme which are usually found in action action films films can also be used

and moods of a human being visualized in film the film itself is mostly a fiction although some are based on fact true stories or based on a true story there are also documentaries with original and real pictures or biographical films that tell the story of a character there are many other popular genre films ranging from action films horror films comedy films romantic films fantasy films thriller films drama films science fiction films crime films documentaries and others thats a little information about the definition of film or movie the information was quoted from various sources and references hope it can be useful tv movie the first television shows were experimental sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the televised events such as the summer olympics in germany the coronation of king george vi in the uk and david sarnoffs famous introduction at the new york worlds fair in the us spurred a growth in the medium but world war ii put a halt to development until after the war the world movie inspired many americans to buy their first television set and then in the popular radio show texaco star theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show earning host milton berle the name mr television and demonstrating that the medium was a stable modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers the first national live television broadcast in the us took place on september when president harry trumans speech at the japanese peace treaty conference in san francisco was transmitted over atts transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets the first national color broadcast the tournament of roses parade in the us occurred on january during the following ten years most network broadcasts and nearly all local programming continued to be in blackandwhite a color transition was announced for the fall of during which over half of all network primetime programming would be broadcast in color the first allcolor primetime season came just one year later in the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color resulting in the first completely allcolor network season formats and genres see also list of genres film and television formats and genres television shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented a show may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or nonfictional as in documentary news and reality television it may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some madefortelevision films or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional movie they could be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows a drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting the program follows their lives and adventures before the shows except for soap operatype serials typically remained static without story arcs and the main characters and premise changed little if some change happened to the characters lives during the episode it was usually undone by the end because of this the episodes could be broadcast in any order since the many movie feature progressive change in the plot the characters or both for instance hill street blues and st elsewhere were two of the first american prime time drama television movie to have this kind of dramatic structure while the later movie babylon further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended fiveseason run in it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies revenues than film some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs in academyawardwinning film director steven soderbergh commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative stated i think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television

,news,vinbeyabadi,iran-s-supreme-leader-vienna-offers-not-worth-looking-at,Iran's Supreme Leader: Vienna Offers 'Not Worth Looking At',irans supreme leader says the offers being made at the vienna talks over his countrys tattered nuclear deal are not worth looking at download by jon gambrell associated press dubai united arab emirates ap irans supreme leader on wednesday dismissed initial offers at talks in vienna to save tehrans tattered nuclear deal as not worth looking at taking a hardline approach after an attack on the countrys main nuclear enrichment site the comments by ayatollah ali khamenei who has final say on all matters of state in the islamic republic come as informal talks in vienna continue ahead of a planned formal round of negotiations the talks already have been thrown into disarray by a weekend attack on irans main natanz nuclear enrichment site suspected to have been carried out by israel tehran retaliated by announcing it would enrich uranium up to higher than it ever has before but still lower than weaponsgrade levels of the offers they provide are usually arrogant and humiliating and are not worth looking at the khamenei said in an address marking the first day of the holy muslim fasting month of ramadan in iran while saying he remained positive about irans negotiators he criticized the us and warned time could be running out the talks shouldnt become talks of attrition khamenei said they shouldnt be in a way that parties drag on and prolong the talks this is harmful to the country speaking to his cabinet an impassioned iranian president hassan rouhani said the firstgeneration centrifuges that were damaged in sundays attack would be replaced by advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium much faster you wanted to make our hands empty during the talks but our hands are full rouhani said rouhani added enrichment is an answer to your evilness we cut off both of your hands one with centrifuges and another one with rouhani also accused israel of being behind the natanz attack apparently this is a crime by the zionists if the zionists take an action against our nation we will respond he said without elaborating in jerusalem at a memorial day commemoration israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu appeared to reference iran we must never remain apathetic to the threats of war and extermination of those who seek to eliminate us he said israel has not claimed the attack though it rarely does in its ongoing shadow war against tehran the talks in vienna are aimed at finding a way for the united states to reenter tehrans nuclear agreement with world powers and have iran comply again with its limits the accord which former president donald trump unilaterally withdrew the us from in prevented iran from stockpiling enough highenriched uranium to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions rouhani in his comments wednesday insisted iran is still hoping that the vienna talks lead to a negotiated settlement over its program and the accompanying lifting of punishing sanctions khamenei as well said he believed in his negotiators but kept up the pressure on the west in his remarks wednesday night they must do what we say first and we are assured that its done then we will do what is we are required to do he said france germany and the united kingdom all parties to the nuclear deal only hours earlier issued a joint statement wednesday expressing their grave concern over irans decision to increase enrichment this is a serious development since the production of highly enriched uranium constitutes an important step in the production of a nuclear weapon the countries said iran has no credible civilian need for enrichment at this level saudi arabia a regional rival to iran similarly issued a statement saying enriching at that level could not be considered a program intended for peaceful purposes the kingdom calls on iran to avoid escalation and not to subject the security and stability of the region to more tension and to engage seriously in the current negotiations saudi arabia said iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful though the west and the international atomic energy agency says tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of an annual us intelligence report released tuesday maintained the american assessment that iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weaponsdevelopment activities that we judge would be necessary to produce a nuclear device iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to for nuclearpowered ships however the islamic republic currently has no such ships in its navy iran had been enriching up to and even that was a short technical step to weaponsgrade levels officials initially said the enrichment would begin wednesday however an early wednesday morning tweet from irans envoy to the iaea kazem gharibabadi suggested it might come later he later posted a letter addressed to iaea directorgeneral rafael grossi warning against any adventurism by the israeli regime against iranian nuclear sites the mostrecent cowardly act of nuclear terrorism will only strengthen our determination to march forward and to replace all damaged centrifuges with even more advanced and sophisticated machines gharibabadi wrote iaea inspectors visited natanz on wednesday on their first trip since the sabotage the agency said without elaborating on what they found the weekend attack at natanz was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding aboveground workshops and underground enrichment halls but later iranian officials began calling it an attack alireza zakani the hardline head of the iranian parliaments research center referred to several thousand centrifuges damaged and destroyed in a state tv interview however no other official has offered that figure and no images of the aftermath have been

while being delivered by a provider the verb to stream refers to the process of delivering or obtaining media in this manner streaming refers to the delivery method of the medium rather than the medium itself distinguishing delivery method from the media distributed applies specifically to telecommunications networks as most of the delivery systems are either inherently streaming eg radio television streaming apps or inherently nonstreaming eg books video cassettes audio cds there are challenges with streaming content on the internet for example users whose internet connection lacks sufficient bandwidth may experience stops lags or slow buffering of the content and users lacking compatible hardware or software systems may be unable to stream certain content live streaming is the delivery of internet content in realtime much as live television broadcasts content over the airwaves via a television signal live internet streaming requires a form of source media eg a video camera an audio interface screen capture software an encoder to digitize the content a media publisher and a content delivery network to distribute and deliver the content live streaming does not need to be recorded at the origination point although it frequently is streaming is an alternative to file downloading a process in which the enduser obtains the entire file for the content before watching or listening to it through streaming an enduser can use their media player to start playing digital video or digital audio content before the entire file has been transmitted the term streaming media can apply to media other than video and audio such as live closed captioning ticker tape and realtime text which are all considered streaming text casting in june it was announced that zhang ziyi had

i have had a rough week with fibromyalgia and i have found it exceedingly difficult to concentrate i think it is a suffering for the divine mercy novena which we are in the middle of right now it ends on sunday the first sunday after easter and it is a nineday prayer cycle for the world different intentions each day it is an immensely powerful novena i have some intel to share with you and please take timing issues with a grain of salt because so much misinformation is being put out there nobody can really trust the details i wanted to get this out of the way so we could stay strictly on spiritual things in my next message i know there is a great deal of confusion in the minds of some wondering why president trump has not been reinstated publicly yet i want to assure you it is coming the military has all it needs to uphold the constitution and put the choice of we the people in the presidents office they have audited the authentic watermarked ballots that revealed that the only state that was for biden was the district of columbia believe it or not new york and california were for trump right now jim carey and james wood are playing the part of biden it has got to be funny it was jim carey that tripped and fell on the stairs and he has a background with stunts i believe biden has already been executed for his crimes against humanity and torturing and raping children it is so horrific that i get sick at just the mention of what the army is revealing in the tunnels that are all over the world not just in america dear ones they are taking hundreds of body bags filled with the body parts of children out of these trafficking tunnels under the white house there were colonies of rats and roaches feeding on human remains there is a channel on youtube that seems very well connected rescue ge is what is it is called and it has been broadcasting the plans to reveal to the public all that has been going on behind the scenes in their youtubes they continue to set dates which keep passing us by without any visible events now they have not posted anything new for almost three days martial law has been in effect for several months that means that the military is in charge period the black hats have hired thugs to cause disruption and rioting when the disclosure of corruption happens so the white hats are being incredibly careful not wanting to set off national rioting i believe they are also threatening to detonate nuclear devices and other weapons of mass destruction hidden in america if everything is revealed to the public and the mainstream media is shut down the military has made great strides in discovering these weapons but it is obvious that all threats have not been neutralized or the military would spill the beans and give the public the red pill another factor is the fragile state of mind of people it is my guess that if the information is released too quickly to the public including the taking down of the mainstream media some people will lose their minds it is after all more bizarre than fiction it seems that the best way to disclose what has been happening is slowly gradually little by little over time what is being said on the channel i believe may be put out there to flush out all the retaliatory moves the black hats have planned or have access to and according to my source that seems to be correct three reasons why they cannot disclose everything suddenly i know you are all waiting for it i know i am every day wondering when is the public broadcasting system going to kick in and when is the truth going to be revealed but there are three reasons why they cannot disclose everything the threat of retaliation is still real and every time they announce a move more black hats come to the surface and are exposed and the public is so lulled into false narratives that they will go into shock when full disclosure is made if it is done too suddenly in the meantime they are arresting prosecuting and executing black hats i just got an update from our intel source and he told me that the evergreen container ship that is stuck in the suez canal was deliberately thrown off course to be stuck in the canal by hacking into their computer the computer that guides the ship the elite russian and elite american corps the green berets etc and egyptians are all cooperating and working together to save these children i was told that there were about children found dead in the containers and still alive according to an army intel source they also found weapons of mass destruction on the ship the

,hive-193186,cheva,wherein-1618466914040-s,说起武汉科技馆, speaking of wuhan science and technology museum generally i think of the large museum which was converted from wuhan passenger transport port in fact there is an old restaurant next to the construction avenue i often pass there when i get to get off work the old museum has been open to the public for a long time but there is a very bullish exhibit a genuine large killing weaponballistic missile since the old museum is not open to the outside world you cannot enter inside to see it can only be seen in the path outside the wall i have also posted it before but these days i have to go there to find the building of the old museum all the exterior walls were demolished leaving only the frame it should be a major renovation i am curious about such a big project is that missile removed i went back from get off work yesterday and went to that road the missile was found there it seems that the science and technology museum also treats this thing as the treasure of the town hall and is reluctant to throw it i found relevant information on the internet according to the shape of the missile figure information found online the shape is very similar this should be an early dongfeng type ballistic missile the range can carry tons of equivalent nuclear warheads at a range of kilometers now this missile has been completely behind and online information has been retired in the the latest domestic intercontinental missile displayed on the national day parade is the dongfeng that can be launched by maneuverability the range can cover the world it can carry hundreds of thousands of tons of equivalent warheads or a slightly slightly powerful championship about nuclear missiles it feels complicated first of all it is used to destroy humans with the highest efficiency human beings use a lot of resources and wisdom to study creating this weapon to eliminate themselves which is simply black humor and unreasonable but you have to admit that due to the existence of nuclear missiles the possibility of large scale wars between major countries around the world has been reduced to almost the huge power of nuclear missiles can calm any war madman and let him realize that war is a very irrational behavior it is the emergence of nuclear missiles that human beings have enjoyed since the end of world war ii to the present the longest world peace in history human civilization has also developed to an unprecedented height during this period but does humans really need to maintain peace in this way is the conflict between human beings really unavoidable do you have to put a nuclear missile the sword of damoris on top of his head can you restrain the idea of killing each other i think it should not be human beings are inherently social mutually beneficial and cooperate in division of labor it comes from everyones instinct the reason why there are wars is still because human beings have a lot of mistakes put individuals in the unrealistic imagination collective under the tribe countries nations religion and even ideology then as the black hedo read some time ago the individual reason that entering the collective will disappear and the constraints of evil will relax three underworlds of other fanaticism will do things that destroy social cooperation such as war so i think that the worlds lasting peace is not to create more nuclear missiles instead people have the right concept and put individuals on the collective to realize the exchange of interests between individuals and division of labor that is everyone is a society for me and i am a society for everyone

作恶的约束也会放松。在极个别的狂热分子的三种下群体就会做出破坏社会协作的事情，比如战争。所以我认为让世界持久和平的办法也许不是制造更多的核导弹。而是让人们具有正确的观念，将个体放在集体之上。实现一个以个体之间利益交换，分工协作为基础的，也就是人人为我，我为人人的社会。"",""device"":""Android"",""tags"":[""cn"",""wherein"",""lifestyle"",""cn-reader"",""kateschoice"",""jjm"",""zzan"",""dblog"",""life"",""thediarygame"",""actnearn"",""marlians"",""upfundme"",""whalepower"",""diamondtoken""]}",2021-04-15T06:08:39+00:00,52900723,"Hubei,

,news,beritapagi,japan-clock-stopped-by-earthquake-restarts-10-years-on,Japan: Clock stopped by earthquake restarts 10 years on,an japanese clock that stopped working after the earthquake has started ticking again after another quake struck this year the clock stored in a buddhist temple was submerged by the tsunami on japans northeastern coast that followed the devastating earthquake which killed more than people in march its owner bunshun sakano then tried to fix the clock without success but when a smaller quake hit years later he says it began working again according to the mainichi shimbun newspaper the springdriven clock was stored in the fumonji temple in yamamoto in japans miyagi region miyagi and neighbouring fukushima were badly hit by the earthquake and tsunami on march the temple which stands a few hundred metres from the coast was struck by the tsunamis waves with only its pillars and roof spared by the deluge after the disaster mr sakano the temples head priest rescued the clock from the debris he rewound it but could not get it to start then on february this year weeks from the anniversary of the disaster the same region was struck by another powerful earthquake meteorologists said they believed it was an aftershock of the massive quake the following morning mr sakano while checking the main hall for any damage heard a ticking sound and found the clock was moving again two months later it is still working the clock which mr sakano bought in an antique shop in nearby fukushima several years before the disaster seems to have been shaken back into action by the force of februarys earthquake a representative of seiko the clocks manufacturer told the mainichi newspaper its possible that the pendulum which had stopped started moving again with the shaking of the earthquake or that dust that had built up inside came loose mr sakano whose temple served as a base for volunteers after the earthquake says he has taken inspiration from the clock restarting maybe its pushing me to move forward with new determination the said its like a sign of encouragement that the real restoration is to come,{},,"{""tags"":[""news""],""links"":[""https://volunteer.alz.org/network/members/profile?UserKey=c35b7f51-522c-4609-83cf-7ec1ff1a7cb0"",""https://volunteer.alz.org/network/members/profile?UserKey=53b565f1-5370-4a4e-b340-e385d1847657"",""https://volunteer.alz.org/network/members/profile?UserKey=40be00b3-da7b-44af-a153-fe1850d2856f"",""https://volunteer.alz.org/network/members/profile?UserKey=8af0601a-55db-439e-ad2b-5b610400c963"",""https://volunteer.alz.org/network/members/profile?UserKey=0a6947ed-230b-46e1-bd07-86e7c25fe9f4"",""https://www.ufrgs.br/lidia-diabetes/forums/users/godzilla-kong-full-movie-online-free/"",""https://www.ufrgs.br/lidia-diabetes/forums/users/godzilla-vs-kong-full-movie-online/"",""https://www.ufrgs.br/lidia-diabetes/forums/users/godzilla-vs-kong-full-online-movie/"",""https://www.ufrgs.br/lidia-diabetes/forums/users/godzilla-vs-kong-hd-full-watch-online/"",""https://www.ufrgs.br/lidia-diabetes/forums/users/wach-godzilla-vs-kong-full-movie/"",""https://tea.instructure.com/courses/249/pages/watch-greys-anatomy-season-17-episode-12-online-full-episodes"",""https://tea.instructure.com/courses/249/pages/greys-anatomy-season-17-episode-12-online-full-episodes"",""https://tea.instructure.com/courses/249/pages/greys-anatomy-season-17-episode-12-online-watch-hd-free"",""https://tea.instructure.com/courses/249/pages/watch-greys-anatomy-season-17-episode-12-hd-online-full-episodes"",""https://tea.instructure.com/courses/249/pages/full-watch-greys-anatomy-season-17-episode-12-online-full-episodes"",""https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/user-article/152014/watch-grey-s-anatomy"",""https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/user-article/152017/grey-s-anatomy"",""https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/user-article/152020/grey-s-anatomy"",""https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/user-article/152021/-watch-grey-s"",""https://classics.honestjohn.co.uk/user-article/152023/full-watch-grey-s"",""https://steemkr.com/news/@jossnews/afghans-face-pivotal-moment-as-us-prepares-to-close-the-book"",""https://cox.tribe.so/post/https-volunteer-alz-org-network-members-profile-userkey-c35b7f51-522c-4609---6077ee5cb912fbbef4a6d1d9"",""https://www.peeranswer.com/question/6077ec15821899210c6ec72a"",""https://paiza.io/projects/MQjG-R11GMH15c8UZ_Ssdw"",""https://www.onlinegdb.com/SJ5T0wH8O"",""https://jsfiddle.net/maxsstream/tfr5xwdc/"",""https://rentry.co/uuskd"",""https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=849553"",""https://www.guest-articles.com/news/afghans-face-pivotal-moment-as-us-prepares-to-close-the-book-15-04-2021"",""https://www.guest-articles.com/news/its-a-dramatically-different-country-than-the-shattered-land-and-pariah-15-04-2021"",""https://www.guest-articles.com/news/us-official-put-it-when-he-broke-the-news-on-tuesday-15-04-2021"",""https://www.guest-articles.com/news/afghans-now-fear-a-terrible-tumbling-towards-civil-war-in-a-conflict-15-04-2021"",""https://dreampirates.us/world/the-taliban-will-just-wait-them-out-and-wont-get-into-substantive-issues-15-04-2021""],""app"":""steemit/0.2"",""format"":""markdown""}",2021-04-15T08:46:27+00:00,52903854,

,hive-179764,bilimkurgu,sasirtici-bir-kiyamet-sonrasi-romani-dr-kan-bedeli,Şaşırtıcı Bir Kıyamet Sonrası Romanı: Dr. Kan Bedeli, philip k dick pkd one of the productive writers of sci fi literature has a special place in and in his career during this period when the hugo award was awarded with the novel adam in the high castle the pkd had a burst of creativity it is a time period that he wrote without stopping from the evening to the morning due to the amphetamine he uses and that his wife r dick helps the work of jewelry design during the day and ended with a psychotic collapse here is dr the blood price is one of the works he has written in this unique period in which he wrote books in two years his full name the novel which we went to after the blood price or the bomb is about the events that developed after a nuclear disaster the name of the book was made by stanley kubrick he evokes the film i learned to stop the strange or how to stop worrying and love the bomb he wrote the pkd book a year before the films screening and did not like the idea of naming the book of editor donald wollheim to evoke the film both works are related to nuclear bombs but there is no common aspect other than to address the nuclear war paranoia of the period dr when it was a film where strange soldiers scientists and politicians were satirized the blood cost is about the efforts of people from the public to hold onto life after the nuclear disaster turkish translation was published in the blood price is a strange novel even in pkd sizes as mentioned in the foreword this oddity is largely due to the extraordinary characters of the novel for example due to the error he made during an experiment dr the blood cost is a very scary figure the hero a megalomanian personality has the kind of powers that a malicious wizard can have in the book the young man who is known as hoppy pokomel or poko who has no arms and legs raises the bar of strangeness pokomel who repaired with the help of prostheses in his small car called pokomobil can see the future and gain the ability to move objects with the power of mind at the summit of the strange characters league there is no doubt his year old edies invisible twin brother named bill bill who has the ability to speak to the dead transfers himself to the body of a snail but he is not satisfied with his new body because the snail is blind as a result of some amazing events that later developed it engages in a fierce struggle with the pokomel which began to be in trouble for people despite all these extraordinary characters pkd dr in the novel of blood price he continues his attitude towards seeing and transferring events from the eyes of people from the people stuart mcconchie one of the main characters of the novel is a typical bench that sweeps the front of the shop in the morning in the first pages of the novel he sees the psychiatrist near the tv store where he works and does not like him pkd wrote for the book he says that he never understands people like blood costs and cannot empathize with them in the same end the pkd states that people who try to build a solidarity life in rural areas after the nuclear disaster represents the hope humor felt from bottom to bottom in pkd books it became a little more prominent in the blood price the fact that stuart mcconchie dreamed that pokomel was eating a mouse and did not like this situation during the sara watch experienced that walter dangerfield who was sent to mars from the world remained in orbit because it coincides with the disaster and from there to the world of morale radio broadcasting in addition names such as hoppy bloodmoney dangerfield stocktill used in the book give readers clue that these characters are caricaturized despite the high dose of creativity it contains it is difficult to say that the blood price is an easy to read novel time shifts one of the pkds portents make it difficult to follow the plot of the novel it requires great attention to capture the transitions between events in and the multi third party expression which provides the transfer of events from the point of view of different characters is one of the factors that require an attentive reading in he was nominated as a candidate for the best novel award within the scope of the nebula awards the turkish translation of the blood price belongs to feyyaz ahin as a result dr blood cost is perfect for those who like extraordinary novels visual source cover of the

,news,vinbeyabadi,exclusive-biden-to-bar-u-s-banks-from-issuing-russian-sovereign-debt,Exclusive: Biden to Bar U.S. Banks From Issuing Russian Sovereign Debt,download by arshad mohammed reuters president joe biden will issue an executive order on thursday authorizing the us government to sanction any sector of the russian economy and will use it to restrict russias ability to issue sovereign debt to punish moscow for interfering in the us election senior biden administration officials said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said biden would bar us financial institutions from taking part in the primary market for roubledenominated russian sovereign bonds from june us banks have been barred from taking part in the primary market for nonrouble sovereign bonds since the latest step is part of a wider array of sanctions the white house plans to announce on thursday to make russia pay a price for malign actions such as election interference cyberhacking the use of chemical weapons and reports that it offered taliban militants bounties to kill us soldiers in afghanistan among the sanctions to be unveiled are the blacklisting of about entities as well as orders expelling about russian officials from the united states one person familiar with the matter said russia denies meddling in us elections orchestrating a cyber hack that used us tech company solarwinds corp to penetrate us government networks and using a nerve agent to poison kremlin critic alexei navalny it has also brushed off allegations of putting bounties on us soldiers in afghanistan biden on tuesday spoke to russian president vladimir putin to raise concerns about these issues and the build up of russian forces in crimea and along the border with ukraine even as he proposed a summit between the two men biden appears to be trying to strike a balance between defending us national interests against russia while making clear he would prefer to have a less volatile relationship and to cooperate on issues such as curbing irans nuclear program the american people should not be complicit in the russian governments malign activities by directly funding the russian state at a time when the russian government is attempting to undermine our sovereignty and threaten our allies and partners said one official echoing the administrations desire for a stable and predictable relationship with russia we dont think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory in the relationship he said however we will defend our national interests and impose costs for russian government actions that seem to harm our sovereignty our goal here is number one to demonstrate resolve by taking an impactful step he added the second goal is to be very clear in our signaling that we have the option to escalate in a far more forceful way if we so choose and that really will be determined by russias actions this official said the executive order authorized the us government to target any sector of the russian economy adding we will not hesitate to expand the russian sovereign debt sanction if russia escalates further the executive order on blocking property with respect to specified harmful foreign activities of the government of the russian federation was signed by biden on wednesday and will be made public on thursday morning us officials said the sovereign debt action which will specifically cite the russian central bank national wealth fund and finance ministry extends a step the united states took in when it barred us financial institutions from buying nonroubledenominated debt directly from russia in the primary market neither move however affects russian sovereign debt traded in the secondary market meaning that us persons can continue to buy and sell such bonds there the first us official said the russian roubledenominated sovereign debt market was valued at about billion about a quarter of which is held by foreign investors us investors make up about half of the foreign holdings he said judging from history removing us investors as buyers in this market will likely cause a chilling effect that raises russias borrowing cost along with capital fight and a weaker currency all of which leads to slower growth and higher inflation said this official dan fried a retired us diplomat now at the atlantic council think tank described the step outlined by the us officials as significant and markedly stronger than former us president donald trumps actions we are signalling that we are prepared to do even more and there are steps that would be quite a bit stronger he said citing the possibility of restrictions on trading in the secondary market which would be a huge deal reporting by arshad mohammed in saint paul minn editing by chizu nomiyama

was about yen for two fan diving and rental full sets with diving plans with diving plans so i think i was able to travel quite cheaply i took an airplane for the first time in over a year but i was tired laughs the inn was able to dive right in front of you with a tropical feeling you can spend a relaxing time on the so called island time in the sea i was able to see various things from the moment i dive and i was able to swim with sea turtles after diving in the morning and afternoon you can rent a car and enjoy the hot springs it is a mixed bathing hot spring with the rules for free and swimsuit which is open to uramogataki onsen it was good that the scenery here had a taste after the hot spring it is a fun dinner from i went to a famous restaurant in hachijojima liangyama you will have a specialty of hachijojima such as stewed sea turtles stewed sea turtles and island sushi this is the sea turtle however this sea turtle is not from hachijojima i remembered the face of the sea turtle i met earlier the photo was shaken but the island sushi was big and delicious after that i went to the inn around at a local bar and today i went to a specialty hot spring again in the morning it is said that it is the second place of the hot spring that was good to go with a tripadvisor called miharashi no yu it was quite in the mountains and there were many celebrities signs in the open air bath because they could overlook the pacific ocean as expected i couldnt get a picture of the bath so i will quote what the scenery looks like the wind was a little strong and cold but it was really superb after this i had lunch and came back on the afternoon flight hachijojima for the first time was the best i thought it might be easier to go rather than going to hakone

netflix and elsewhere is warned of spoilers although i try to tell nothing more the basic premise threatening meteorite attack the stupid homo idioticus knows nothing better than nuclear missiles well gravity and radiation a bunch of crap comes down from above mutations in the animal world huge insects giant frogs and what you like to imagine in your nightmares fortunately the titms do not survive are eaten or trampled immediately the remaining wimps hide in bunkers underground that sounds very entertaining and promising as the main actor we would have dylan obrien i only know from the teen wolf series basically the roles do not differ greatly stiles from teen wolf and also joel dawson are both clumsy jewelry cannon food for the big break to describe it nicely yondu udonta michael rooker is there in a short but important supporting role the rest of the cast is unknown to me but the dog is cool makes a better impression like bbchen so the main actor boy has been in love with a girl from another bunker for years radio contact he wants to go there bbchen goes to the life threatening surface and struggles through a steep learning curve walks through we see really appealing monster cgi where i dont want to expose anything its fun to see the fights you are happy when a monster is blown up and burst that was the hardest scene in the film so completely harmless and also fsk the love stuff would not have needed it you should have found a different motivation and could therefore do without the last quarter or half an hour and replace it with a slightly better action bbchen arrives at the destination and then completely disturbing plot comes into the film that i would not have needed personally conclusion delicious monster entertainment for young and old is fun cineastes that expect action correct action and a completely well thought out script may stay away anyone who likes monster will have their joy naive entertainment stays for in between even more monster

,hive-172186,azianthony,introduction-about-spider-tarantula-spider,INTRODUCTION ABOUT SPIDER(TARANTULA SPIDER),images tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy spiders of the family theraphosidae technically spiders possess setae not true hairs currently about species have been identified the term tarantula is usually used to describe members of the family theraphosidae although many other members of the same infraorder mygalomorphae are commonly referred to as tarantulas or false tarantulas some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade many new world species kept as pets have urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin and in extreme cases cause damage to the eyes tarantula temporal range neogenepresent brachypelma klaasi croppedjpg mexican pink tarantula brachypelma klaasi scientific classification e kingdom animalia phylum arthropoda subphylum chelicerata class arachnida order araneae infraorder mygalomorphae clade avicularioidea family theraphosidae thorell diversity genera species overview like all arthropods the tarantula is an invertebrate that relies on an exoskeleton for muscular support like other arachnida a tarantulas body comprises two main parts the prosoma or cephalothorax and the opisthosoma or abdomen the prosoma and opisthosoma are connected by the pedicel or pregenital somite this waistlike connecting piece is actually part of the prosoma and gives the opisthosoma a wide range of motion relative to the prosoma tarantula sizes can range from as small as the size of a bb pellet to as large as a dinner plate when the legs are fully extended depending on the species the body length of tarantulas ranges from to in to mm with leg spans of cm in leg span is determined by measuring from the tip of the back leg to the tip of the front leg on the opposite side some of the largest species of tarantula may weigh over g oz the largest of all the goliath birdeater theraphosa blondi from venezuela and brazil has been reported to attain a weight of g oz and a legspan up to cm in males being longer and females greater in girth the fang size of this tarantula reaches a maximum of cm in theraphosa apophysis the pinkfoot goliath was described years after the goliath birdeater so its characteristics are not as well attested t blondi is generally thought to be the heaviest tarantula and t apophysis has the greatest leg span two other species lasiodora parahybana the brazilian salmon birdeater and lasiodora klugi rival the size of the two goliath spiders tarantula at the mouth of its burrow most species of north american tarantulas are brown elsewhere species have been found that variously display cobalt blue cyriopagopus lividus black with white stripes aphonopelma seemanni yellow leg markings eupalaestrus campestratus metallic blue legs with vibrant orange abdomen and green prosoma chromatopelma cyaneopubescens their natural habitats include savanna grassland such as in the pampas rainforest desert scrubland mountains and cloud forest they are generally classed among the terrestrial types they are burrowers that live in the ground

,hive-171319,slon21veka,interview-with-god-intervyu-s-bogom,Interview with God! // Интервью с Богом!, the day began not with coffee well somehow strange it began i woke up to the alarm clock i dont understand why i need it then yes i turn off the sound at night yes i turn off the internet for the night and here morning outside the window the window is harsh clouds the soul is strange mystery including the internet the sound on the phone and i see a strange message on steemit from a strange nickname god of almost eight billion people i chose you for an interview with me turn off the internet go outside and go straight i will give you a sign and further no one should know where you are going do not take phones and other gadgets with you for an interview you will have exactly a minute while you will go think about questions to me remember exactly a minute you will have what it is who is god i wanted to see the nickname but it was displayed that there was no such nickname on steemit i have to save the message i thought and i go back but there is no message i update the page there is no message i dont understand anything you must probably get up wash change clothes and go out but where to go straight sign thoughts of the cycle minute yes i have questions for whole eternity and what to ask what a day all i get up at home pleasant and familiar voices of his wife and daughter are heard yes for the sake of them i live maybe ask him something for them good morning dad dear morning daughter good morning beloved good morning sunshine yes they stood up a little earlier than me distance learning in school subjects begin early this coronavirus here one question has formed when will the pandemic end although if this is a god do such questions need to be asked and here i am in the bathroom turn on the water if you want cold you want hot you want warm you want a strong pressure you want a weak but somewhere in africa yes there are countries where they only dream of water where is justice god and wars and riots and alcohol drugs debauchery the more you think the more questions but what about the future how can our children live in such a shit further and if there is the third world or nuclear although the information war as it turned out is much more effective and worse than all other wars drink or not drink tea thats the question and in africa i wont have breakfast ill go right away because i dont even know how much to go and where i began to dress dad where are you it to go to one important meeting since morning yes urgently need i will try to return faster and play in dominoes or checkers good yes we havent played dominoes for a long time that and play but i have to go you are some kind of mysterious this is probably because of the weather thats it i ran away what i saw outside the window seemed flowers on the street it was not so gray but also crushed cloud cover on the whole inner world i left the entrance and began to think where to go it was possible to go left there are immediately villages and fewer people and cars and it was possible to right there the truth is constantly flying and you cant really talk i will go in rural areas probably first ill go to the places where we love to walk with my daughter silence around as if on purpose and then i understand that i am absolutely not ready for a meeting i do not know what to ask i understand that he has an answer to any question but what to ask me about his attitude to religion about how to stop madness in the world about how to live further or maybe ask how much we have to exist here how does he look at the bible why do people go crazy what to ask how much does i have to live do i live right or or why am i by the way why did he choose me for an interview exactly the first question is why i am i also want to ask why people are so interested in other planets does this really make sense and i also want to ask god if he was tired of questions from curses and i am more than sure that a lot of dissatisfaction goes in his direction after all a person cannot understand why other people die why do we kill each other why do we destroy the world what is it through clouds and clouds dazzling rays of the sun suddenly began to appear or it was not the sun but it became brighter and brighter it was impossible to look somewhere i wanted to close my eyes and not to open i imagined him to see him and then a loud voice is heard he was everywhere it feels like he was not alone well my friend it hurts to look into my eyes so there is a lot of light that i cant watch okay open your eyes i removed the rays i opened my eyes he was nearby and not at all that i imagined it the entire internet is littered with various drawings of god similar to jesus but a man stood in front of me and the worst thing he was a copy of me like this you are me i can be anyone but i thought that it would be easier for you no i still havent talked to himself except mentally or at the mirror remember my strange message yes i can interview you and i have exactly seconds for this ready no i dont know what to ask now if more time i have been talking to you all my life he took out the hourglass as if from the air lets not lose your time and he turned the clock why me why of all the inhabitants of the planet earth did you choose me you are looking for the truth and meaning of life you want to use good in the right direction but you dont know how and how do i continue to live continue to search and create yes i see how difficult it is for you but yes its difficult for everyone everyone is looking for they are looking for a selfish purpose and you and to be honest i cant understand why people are fighting fighting drinking smoking deceiving and doing a lot of good deeds think wall because it will not be the same as we live now pandemia viruses media politics nothing eternal happens but i yes i am eternity everything i was not ready to meet you i have no questions to you but there is one big but and what you know everything perfectly i just want to thank you yes i say to you thank you for what everyone hate me call me i felt a mockery of god here and the sand inexorably walked to the end listen god and you throw out this hourglass i have little one minute persuaded and the clock exploded in the air and evaporated as if there werent them come on lets sit down i want to ask you stupid questions well lets sit down on a pebble near the roadside we sat on a stone ahead of emptiness only a field and sunset yes time flew so quickly that the sun was already sitting over the horizon why through steemit after all it was possible to call or so in a voice and you have the topic of the week corresponding yes and i have to read you all an excellent community came up with you there three countries and together oh yes now it is so important when you can at least unite here my friend you can unite everywhere the main thing is to want you read steemit how do you like the platform i like this blockchain more precisely two in one and steem and tron yes you are advanced god and you thought that satoshi tsumotot is a person come on seriously i thought it was a person or team of a secret group of people ask questions better why do people refuse their own children uncertainty and search for light life not everyone loves difficulties you answered so easily as if you did not care i dont care but no one canceled the boomerang i hope there is still a question ask space so we have learned to fly into space we were already allowed to go to mars road tell me is there any meaning in all this you did not finish the question well if it is a point in all this if we have not learned how to live here on planet earth respond no need which of us is god made me laugh my unloved question when will i die or what why do you need to know about this it would be better to ask how to live a life more efficiently and how no way live yourself and enjoy how i can enjoy if so much grief and troubles around you are a god not so enjoy your life but what about those who really need help help if you can but i want to help more because i know that if not we then who look for opportunities and help you will succeed what is my mission not even so that you wanted to get from me just give good and teach the world good you go in small steps in this direction just dont stop o one more question the church for you is an ordinary house for those who want to pray you hear prayers you never understand what should i understand you are god and thats it this means that you are in me yes the sun has long sat over the horizon there was darkness and silence unusual silence and darkness there was no light anywhere but it was necessary to go home at home they probably worried very much because i did not take anything with me i saw the road and reached it home yes they worried at home reassured after he sat down no not for breakfast or lunch or dinner i immediately turned on the computer suddenly again some kind of message from god the interview turned out wonderful write a post about this i assure you you will be pleasantly surprised that st appreciate you the main thing is to write about d the end who what about what i do not get it ill update the page to read the text to the end but but again i did not take a picture of the text from god and what else was written there in principle it doesnt matter but to talk about your vision or interview with god it is necessary but indeed at any moment with each of us such a miracle can happen and at such moments we are sure to be lost and do not know what to ask friends but if you had the opportunity take an interview from god what would you ask him about come to the topic of the week and write your thoughts he sees and reads us after all it is not necessary to go to church or temple you can contact him here he hears everything and he sees everything whole so god yes i see everything i invite each of you take part in an interview link below ,"{""profile"":{""profile_image"":""http://i.imgsafe.org/05ad9107a3.jpg"",""location"":""World"",""about"":""The most kind elephant in the
